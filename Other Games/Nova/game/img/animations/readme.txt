To use script:

Update the Source variable in the root directory to match the filepath you're currently using

Call from commandline with the format : Png2Webm.bat sunrays 000
Where:
- sunrays is the foldername which holds the images
- 000 is the number format used by the pngs
- and the filenames of the files should be the format of sunrays000.png,  sunrays001.png etc.

This will produce the following:
sunrays_real.webm
sunrays_mask.webm
