Ugh, how far away is this damn city anyways?
#cg jonah with map
#sound - Map unfold
Jonah Mumbles to himself as he sits at the side of the road and opens a well used map.
The sooner i make it there, the sooner i can put my feet up and relax.
Traveling is all well and good, but all this walking is doing my feet no favours.
He looks around for some landmarks to use to judge the distance to the City from his current location.
Well if this is.. and then that... Hmm...
He mumbles to himself as his fingers trace the map.
Its not that far after all, looks like a few more hours should do it. 
If we keep up the pace we should be at the City just before Nightfall, what do you think little buddy?
Jonah poses his question to the little bird who had perched to once side and was watching him carefully from a safe distance.
He grabbed a stale piece of bread from his bag and pulled a piece off. Then after pulling a smaller piece from it put the rest in his mouth.
No comment?
He asked again with a mouth full, flicking the small piece of bread in his hand towards the bird.
Ugh, so dry. 
He mumbled to himself. The bird pecked at the morsel, unsure where best to grab it from.
Don't worry, the food in the city will be much better.
Stick with me kid, you'll go places.
Jonah put on a voice and winked at the bird.
Almost as if on cue, the bird grabbed the piece of bread and flew off into the nearby trees.
Kids these days, no respect.
Jonah pretended to grumble to himself like an old man, as he folded the map back up again and got back on his feet.
Well If i want to make it to town by Nightfall i better hit the road.
And who needs you anyway ya damn bird...
His voice trails off as something shiny catches his eye.
#Music Mood - Interest?
#cg glint in the grass
#sound - glint
Huh? Whats that?
There was definitely something there, the glint of the sun catching the metal was unmistakable.
A metal scrap? A coin? Something precious?
Jonahs mind started to race through all the possibilities, as well as through all the possible things he could buy with the money made from selling the wondrous possible treasure that had fallen in his lap.
He wandered over to investigate further.
#cg the cursed ring close up
#Music Mood - Spooky
A ring?
It was an odd ring, it was well crafted but there was something about it.
How strange.
Jonah picked it up to examine it closer, but as soon as he touched it a shiver was sent down his arm.
Is it a magic ring?
The longer he touched it the more the eerie feeling around the ring grew.
Ugh, This is probably cursed.
He spoke aloud to no one in particular, stating the obvious.
Looking around to make sure there wasn't any poor sod looking for a lost ring, he decided to keep it anyways.
Eh, theres always someone willing to buy things like this, curse or no.
Grabbing a piece of cloth from his bag he carefully wrapped up the ring and placed it back in his bag.
Either way, i better get going or ill be camping outside again, and that id rather avoid.
#Music Mood - Everyday/Journey
Jonah hoisted himself back upright and started again on his journey to the city
