Jonah Foxe

Jonah is a lazy, somewhat diligent and soft-hearted person. He doesn't like to do much work, especially if theres no money to be made in it. He desires to rest and eat after a hard work or battle. He is quick witted, intelligent and has a silver tongue that he can use to sell things as well as getting himself in and out of trouble. 

"You'd be surprised what things people will just discard, and even more surprised at how many other people would pay to have them instead."

Mallory Wescotte

Mallory is a somewhat spoiled child, with an obsession with odd curios and knicknacks. She also has pretty poor luck with regards to said curios, though this never dampens her drive to find/acquire and study more and more of these items. She currently lives with her father, who has apparently be growing increasingly annoyed at the damage her hobby seems to cause.

"What a strange looking thing. I must have it!"

Louella Arkwrighte 

A loyal bodyguard, Louella has been looking after Mallory for the last 10 years of her life after Mallorys mother passed away. Somewhat stoic, she rarely shows much outward emotion. However in their time together Mallory has learned to pick up on the very subtle signs she displays while hiding her true feelings. Louella has grown to care deeply for Mallory and would lay down her life to protect her if the situation called for it.

"I'd advise you keep your hands to yourself if you don't want to lose them."
