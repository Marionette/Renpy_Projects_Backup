So, What do you think of my plan?
...
Guys?
...
...
Oh they're sleeping. Typical.
Well hello there. This is me. Samuel, or Sam if you'd prefer. I'm 1/3 of this particular chimera.
Its not easy being me. I mean when you think of a chimera, you always think of the lion head, or maybe even the goat head. Never the tail. I'm always an afterthought.
Heck if you had been shocked that I was even alive you wouldn't be the first.
But anyway. Enough moaning. What this snake is really interested in is...
 Well its kind of embarrassing to say...
...
...Its love. I'm in love. Yes, shocking I know. 
This is the object of my affections. 
Her name is Melissa, she's basically the perfect girl.
...
Those beautiful eyes...
That cute smile...
Those smooth scales and that slithering hair...
Just thinking about her makes me go all fuzzy inside.
Who are you talking to?
AHH! Y-You're awake.
I-I didn't realise I was saying that all out loud.
Yeeeeaaaaah.
Annnyway. How much of my plan do you remember hearing before falling asleep?
...
What plan?
...
You know what? Never mind.
GUYS!
Waaah!
Guys. I just had. The weirdest dream. Like seriously.
I mean there was this shark, only like it was huge. And we were like riding on its back.
We were riding a shark?
Yeah, only like, it was flying. And that girl was there too.
Who?
Girl?
I er, never mind that's not important. Then the shark exploded and when I woke up in the dream Sammy was droning on and on about something boring so I went back to sleep.
...I don't think that was the dream
but the shark didn't come back so I woke up again, only for real this time.
That's so strange.
Yeah, I thought for sure it'd come back.
Er that's not really what I meant...
By the way guys, weren't we supposed to be somewhere by now?
We were?
Aww nuts. We need to hurry or they'll be sold out.

Finally we're here!
...
...
We still need to hurry or the new Pocket Humans game will be old out!
Its easy...for you...you never...do any of...the running.
...
Hey! I help us...er steer.
Anyway lets get in there.
*BUMP*
HEY!
Watch where you're going you big oaf!
How about you wat...
...
..I mean, Pardon us.
I hope you're not hurt.
W-Well I guess I'm OK.
I haven't seen her around here before...
...
I haven't seen you around, are you new here?
What? I don't work here.
No I mean in the area.
I don't work in the area either.
I'm not asking about your job, I'm asking about you.
What about me?
...
Did you move here.
To the store?
The area.
OOOOh you mean did I move to town. 
Yeah, that's what I meant.
...
Then yeah, we moved here from back home.
We?
Yeah me and my parents. They run the new bakery on the other side of town.
I LOVE CAKE!
Whoa!
...
Sorry about him. He's gets excited easily. Its true though, he really does. One time he ate so much all three of us got sick. 
Haha you guys are strange.
Well we try. 
Well I gotta get going. I should be back at the bakery by now. 
See you again sometime.
Bye~
...
...
Gor you're being awful quiet.
I-It's n-nothing.
I'm sure it is.
Crap! I forgot the game.
We want to buy a copy of Pocket Humans!
Sorry I just sold the last copy. And it'll probably be a while before we can get more stock.
Noooooooo...
...ooooooooo...
...ooooooooo
I still have a copy of the Digital Humans game though if you're interested.
Yeah, you still have it because nobody wants to play it. 
Well actually...
Well something is better than nothing I guess.
We don't have time for chit chat! Lets go!
We want to buy a copy of Pocket Humans!
Lucky you, here's the last copy.
AWESOME!
YES!
WHOOO!
We got it, and the last copy too. Its a good thing we ran here after all.
You mean good that we ran.
Dont sweat the small stuff.
Dibs on first go.
...nuts. I wanted to go first.
Seconds!
Aw for flips sakes.
Ha ha looks like sammy takes up the rear as always. 
Life is so unfair sometimes.
Ok lets go home and try it out then.
*BUMP*
Oh my, im so sorry
No, its our fa...
(OMG ITS HER! OHSHITSHITSHIT! WHAT DO I DO NOW?)
Oh its you guys. Hi~
...
Hello there.
Oh you dropped something, Is it that something humans game everyone is raving about?
...
We're just heading home to play it now!
(Speak up dammit!)
Well have fun with that.
See ya.
Goodbye
Bye~
(Yeah right. If I could say that there would be no need for this game.)
(Yeah right. If I could say that there would be no need for this game.)
(Sigh. What is wrong with me?)
Lets just go home.
I can't wait to play~
Yeah its getting late, lets go.

Time to play this~.
I'll just read a book then.
I think I'm just going to go to sleep now.
Ha ha, Sammy's mad that he couldn't talk to his giiiirrrrllllfriend~
Again.
S-Shut up you two!
(But he hit the mark. Why am I fine in any other situation, but as soon as she appears it's like I lose the ability to speak.)
(I just never know what to say to her. Maybe I need to get these guys to help me out.)
(I guess ill ask in the morning...)
Beep beep beep
Mmmm its morning already?
Umm...no don't...bring her back...
Looks like Leo is talking in his sleep again. Wonder what he's dreaming about?
Probably something weird like always.
Oh you're awake, Morning.
Good morning Sam.
Mumble...mumble...DAMN YOU SHARK!
...
Good morning Leo.
Morning.
Bad dream?
I dunno, it was weird.
All your dreams are weird though.
I guess you're right. Ha ha.
Anyway guys. I need your help with something.
What is it?
Ok ok, you know Melissa.
Your giiiirrrrllllfriend?
...
I want to ask her out on a date.
And?
Well you've seen how I get around her. 
I need you guys to like prompt me when I'm talking to her so I don't just sit there with my foot in my mouth the whole time.
You don't have feet though?
I mean i just need to guys to say something to me if I start to clam up while talking to her. To keep the conversation flowing until I'm able to ask her out.
Sounds easy, OK.
Well actually...
Gordon?
I wouldn't want to mess it up.
Mess it up? That's not like you.
I don't know what's wrong with me, but ever since yesterday I cant think straight.
...yesterday?
That harpy we bumped into yesterday. I can't get her out of my mind.
I've no idea why but suddenly I find that everything reminds me of her.
Hmmm...
Ok, how about this. If I help you with your problem then you're mind will be at ease and you'll be able to help me, right?
Well I guess that makes sense, but how?
I think I have an idea.
Oh now that you mention it.
Hmm?
I have something you can help with too. If you want my help that is.
What but you already...
What was before you were offering help as well.
But...
I've already decided.
Aww for flips sakes.
OK, then ill help both of you.
But then you guys have to help me. Deal?
Deal.
Deal.
Well then lets get started right away.
So what should I do now?
I guess im helping Leon then.
So leo, er how can i help you?
Well i guess what i really want is to ask you a few things.
You know Melissa?
Y-Yeah?
When you see her how does it make you feel?
Hmm.
What about when you think of you both together
Hmm, i see.
Why do you ask?
Wait one more question.
When you think about Melissa and the Future what comes to mind most often?
What's a harem?
Y-You don't need to know that Leo.
OK, I think that's enough.
So are you going to explain what the questions were for?
I thought you wanted me to help you.
I just wanted to see if what I was feeling was the same as what you are
And is it?
Yes. Its a perfect match!
Eh... close enough.
Nah, seems like its something different.
Will I still be able to help?
Nah its ok, you've helped enough, I know what I have is something different so ill just deal with it on my own at some point.
So what now?
Ok, now for the bonus question~
More questions?
This is the last one for reals.
Ok, hit me.
Ok, when you see Melissa what is it you want to ask her and why?
You know, because I'm broke.
Come on Sam, take this seriously.
So we can spend the rest of our lives together.
So we can get to know one another better.
OK I think I have enough information. Thanks guys.
No problem.
So are you going to tell us who it is you fancy?
You'll find out when we get there.
Gor, do you know who it is?
I think I have a fair idea.
How come I never noticed anything before?
Probably because all you ever think about is that Medusa.
...oh. (I guess its true, I'm always so wrapped up in my own problems that i never really think about theirs.) 
Ha Ha, don't worry about it. I think you've helped him out considerably with this.
He's never been the sharpest claw in the paw after all, so he needs a little push every now and then.
Anyway, you'll see one way or another soon enough.
Oh hello there guys, heading out?
Oh hi Persephone. 
(Persephone is our neighbour, she's been around here almost as long as we have. Which is strange considering that she's a Human. They don't often settle near monsters like us.)
Hello there.
Oh yeah Leo. I got something for you.
A fish?
Awesome!
Who's a good kitty?
(Is she rubbing his chin? What a strange person.)
Prrrr. No wait.
Persephone. There's something I want to ask you.
(Wait, its her?!)
Ask me? What is it?
Persephone...
Will you marry me?
W-W-W-WHAT?!
...
T-That's not what I meant when I...
Will you go out on a date with me?
So that's why you were asking.
You had feeling for Persephone but weren't sure what they were or what to do about them.
Well for now lets see how this pans out.
Hmmmm...
...
...
...
OK~
W-What?!
She said yes!
Good for you Leo.
But lets start with a date first, OK?
Okay~
Well that was easy. I guess this like this happen too. Maybe I shouldn't be so nervous about asking Melissa?
But, there is one small thing...
What is it?
You have to convince my father to allow it.
Y-Your father?
Y-You mean the big scary guy who lives in the same house as you?
(The reason you don't see many humans near monsters is because they fear us. But not this one. They say killed a Minotaur with his bare hands!)
Yes, unfortunately he's very protective and wont allow me to do anything without his permission.
And you just listen to him?
Its a little stifling but I know he does it because he's worried about me, and I love him so its only right that I follow his wishes.
U-Unless you have changed your mind about us...
N-No. O-Of course not. I-I'll convince him!
Perfect~ Ill go get him now, he's in the house.
W-What?! R-Right now?
What should I do?
You're right Sammy.
I-I'll come back when im more prepared.
Yeah lets get out of here before we get killed.
I-I guess you're right. If i want this i have to face the music.
Well said.
(At least if we die we'll die together.)
Hi guys. He's on his way out. Said he had to get his helmet or something.
Ohshi..
Preparing for a fight?
W-What should I do?
Ahem!
So which one is it?
This one father
Y-Yeah, its me. Hello there.
I dont like him.
*Gulp*
Yes sir, i agree!
(W-What is he saying?!)
You...You agree? You mean you don't like me either?
Yes sir!
Heh, well at least he's got some balls.
Tch, well I don't like your face.
(W-What is he saying?!)
You really like this Jerk, Pea dear?
H-He's not normally like this I don't know what's going on.
Er Well I...
But you don't even know me yet!
(W-What is he saying?!)
What did you say?
I-I said, you should get to know me better before you decide you don't like me.
H-He's right father!
Quiet. This is between the two of us.
Ok, im going to cut to the chase here.
I dont like you and i wont have my daughter taken away from me by some freakish cat with other stupid animals stuck on it.
Yeah, I guess... No wait.
I won't let that one slide.
...
Thats what i thought. Come with me Pea.
Leo...
...
...
...
Lets go home guys.
I'm going to have to ask you to apologize.
I'm sorry, what?
(Holy crap he looks pissed now.)
Say what you want about me, but i can't let you say things like that about the people i care about.
(He's deadly serious about this, its been a long time since I' saw Leo this worked up.)
...
...
I apologize.
If you wont I'll hav... What?!
Im sorry i didn't mean to offend you or the others. 
(What is going on? I dont understand at all.)
I'm just so worried about my daughter you see, i had to make sure you were the sort of guy to stand up for yourself, and most of all stand up for her.
Honestly I knew this day would come eventually. She talks about you a lot, and you really seem like a nice fellow.
So now that I'm satisfied that you're not a wimp I'm not against this union.
So I guess its up to Persephone now.
So Persephone, will you by my Girlfriend?
Well actually during this I've learned some things about you I didn't know before Leo.
I don't think it would work out after all, I'm sorry.
...
Leo...
...
Lets just go home guys.
Yes!
WHOOHOO!
Good Job Leo.
Congratulations Leo.
Let me know when you've figured out where you're talking me on our first date~
Bye Leo~
Goodbye Leo, I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of each other from now on.
Goodbye Sir.
Bye Pea~
Well all well that ends well.
Yep, lets go home.
Yeah, I'm surprisingly tired after all that.
I agree, even though we weren't really involved it was still nerve-wracking.
I guess im helping Gordon then.
So about that Harpy.
What do you suggest i do?
You should get to know her better and see how it goes
It'll be a good chance to get to know her better
Yeah maybe you're right.
I'll just try to forget her.
You're right. I need to get to know her better.
Yeah, because you don't even know her name.
Yeah, we don't know much about her at all.
How will we find her?
I guess all we can do is look around town and hope we find her.
Didn't she say something about cakes?
No that was you Leo.
But she did mention a bakery, maybe we should check it out?
All right, lets just call it a day.
Yeah I'm tired.
I'm hungry. Lets get some cake.
Uh...why cake?
I like cake.
You like a lot of things.
Yeah but there's a bakery across the street.
Oh, so there is. Should we go in?
Sure, why not?
I don't think she's here.
Wait since we're here I want to see if they have that book in stock yet.
...
They still don't have it.
I'd have thought you of all people wouldn't want to waste time.
Its a really good book though!
Well its your choice.
I don't think she's here.
OK give me a second, I want to see if they have any new games in.
Can't we do it another time?
We're already here, it'll only take a second.
...
Ha ha, that took longer than expected. I didn't even know they were making a sequel to that one.
Well its a pretty big park lets split up and look for her.
...
...
Come on, not even a chuckle?
I don't get it.
(Why do i even bother?)
...
I don't think she's here.
I don't think we've been in this one before.
I don't think so.
Welcome~
We found her!
Hi!
Oh its the guys from the game store.
Hows it going?
We were wondering if you have some time to talk to us?
Well you're pretty early so sure. We dont get many customers at this time so i was getting bored anyway.
I guess theres still some time before the rush starts so sure, why not?
Its getting pretty busy so you'll have to make it quick.
So how can I help you
Just talk to her Gor.
I don't know what to ask. How do I start a conversation?
Don't worry I'll give you cues.
Er first of all...
Definitely a good place to start.
3 sizes?
I-I can't ask that!
That might be an interesting story to hear.
Or ask her what being a cake is like.
I think you should stop trying to help Leo.
Aww.
Wait wait, before you start I just realised I don't know what to call you guys. 
Oh my Apologies, my name is Gordon.
Mine is Samuel.
I'm Leo.
My Name is Helen, nice to meet you~
So do you work here?
Not normally, but one of the part timers called in sick so I got drafted.
I wouldn't mind if I was getting paid.
You don't get paid.
No, apparently getting dinner every day should be payment enough.
That's pretty harsh.
Such is life i guess.
You can fly right? What's it like?
Well technically, yes I can.
Technically?
Technically.
Er what do you mean?
It's kind of embarrassing.
What is?
I don't fly much.
You don't?
No, I don't.
(Wow this girl likes to beat around the bush, doesn't she?)
Can I ask why not.
I-I'm afraid.
Afraid?
Yeah, I'm afraid of heights. Pretty shameful problem for a harpy.
I see, it must be hard for you.
Y-You're not going to laugh or make fun of me?
Why would I? It's not like being afraid of heights is that uncommon.
(I dunno, I personally want to poke fun at her now...I'm a horrible fellow, aren't I?)
I-I guess.
Most people I tell certainly find it amusing. You're a strange fellow.
I-I'm sorry?
Haha, I don't mean in a bad way.
What next?
Why not ask about her interests?
So what kinds of things are you interested in?
Hmmm...Guess.
What?
Guess.
Guess what?
Guess my interests.
Can't you tell me?
Don't be so boring.
O-Ok
Do you like movies?
Well it depends on the movie I guess. As long as its nothing sappy or boring I'm generally OK.
Unfortunately I don't get to go as often as I like.
No? Why not.
Lets just say I have a sweet tooth and a small allowance and leave it at that.
Haha. Poor girl.
Hey don't laugh!
Im sorry.
Actually now that I think about it, you always look so serious, you should smile more often.
...
Ha, he's blushing!
S-Shut up Leo!
Do you like Video Games?
Bing Bong! We have a winner!
W-What?
I love video games. Especially the Digital Human ones.
Ha ha, Sam is always telling me that nobody likes those. I think they're a lot more interesting than the Pocket Humans games. 
Being outnumbered sucks.
Pfft. Pocket Humans rules.
Hahahaha. You guys crack me up.
Do you like hiking and things like that?
Er not really, im more of an indoor person.
I see.
Do you like flying?
...No.
(Guess its a sore point.)
Well I guess I better get back to work now.
Well it was nice talking to you.
You too Gordon.
See you later guys~
...
Wait...
Yes?
Would you like to go out for coffee some time?
Hmmm...Sure why not.
Awesome!
Good job Gor!
Congrats.
Let me know when you think of a date and time.
Okay!
Lets go home guys.
Hmm... Maybe another time. I've been really busy lately.
O-Okay, i understand.
...
...
Goodbye
Bye guys.
Lets go home guys.
N-Nevermind. 
Lets go home guys.
Would you like to go to the movies with me?
Hmm...what movie?
OHMYGODYES!!!
Ahem. I mean, Yeah sure, whatever.
Eww. I'm not into that sort of movie
Oh, nevermind then.
Lets go guys.
Isn't that the one with Kaiju Reeves? I guess it might be OK.
Awesome.
Actually if you come back when my shift is over we can still make the last showing.
I-I mean if that is okay with you.
S-Sure!
...
That was AMAZING!
It was pretty good.
OK so it didn't put me to sleep, but I still prefer Pocket Humans.
Ahahaha. So stubborn Sammy.
That was pretty interesting.
I enjoyed it too.
Just interesting? Ill never understand some people.
I ran out of popcorn before the movie started. 
I told you to slow down Leo.
Anyway I had fun Gordon. Thanks for walking me back.
I did too Helen. And no problem.
So Gordon.
Yes?
Will you go out with me again sometime?
I-I would be glad to!
Sam...does it still count if the girl asks the guy?
I-I don't see why not.
Good job Gor!
Congrats man. 
Lets go home guys.
See you again guys.
Bye.
Bye.
Goodbye Helen.
Actually on second thoughts, im pretty busy so i wont be able to join you after all.
Sorry.
I-It's ok. I understand.
...
...
Goodbye.
Bye guys.
Lets go home guys.
Hmm, if I don't help out the others I might not be able to rely on them if something comes up...
I guess that means its my turn.
I wont be able to avoid doing this much longer I guess.
I've got your back Sammy.
I'm right behind you Sam. You don't have to worry.
Thanks
OK, I'm going to ask her out today.
Go for it Sammy!
Wait, how will I find her?
Well what do you know about her?
Well she's amazing!
I mean, like where she lives, or what she does etc.
I-I don't know. I was never able to ask much before.
Well now that I think about it, I often see her in the park so it might be a good idea to check there.
(Hmmm... Gordon seems to be lost in thought about something. I wonder what it is?)
All right, its getting late. Lets just call it a day.
Yeah, we can try again some other day.
I don't think she's here.
Wait since we're here I want to see if they have that book in stock yet.
...
They still don't have it.
I don't really want to waste too much time.
Its a really good book though!
Up to 50% off?!
I don't think she's here.
OK give me a second, I want to see if they have any new games in.
Can't we do it another time?
We're already here, it'll only take a second.
Yeah the good stuff might be gone later
...
I don't think she's here.
We should some cake.
But the line is so long.
But I'm hungry
You're not going to budge are you?
Nope.
...
Happy now?
Yep.
I don't think she's here.
Why don't we ask around and see if anyone has seen her today.
...
So she's at the lake?
That's what the lady at the fountain said.
OK then, lets go.
OK OK. You can do this. Just breathe. You're ready for this.
Er Sam, you're talking to yourself out loud again.
S-Sorry. I'm just nervous.
Oh there she is.
Looks like she's swimming in the Lake.
She's all wet, I wonder if she was in the water.
Oh hello there guys. What brings you around here?
Oh nothing much.
Just happened to be in the area.
...Right Sam?
That's nice. Lovely day for a stroll isn't it?
Y-Yeah, it sure is.
Yeah, this weather is perfect for swimming.
Oh? Did you want me for something?
(What have you done?!)
...
No?
Y-Yes, I just wanted to talk to you.
Oh I see. What did you want to talk about?
...
Sam
S-So what are you doing?
Well I'm swimming. If you cant tell by looking I must be doing it wrong...
N-No not at all. You look like you're doing great.
Well I just finished swimming.
Why don't you ask her about it Sam?
Erm Melissa...
Yes?
Well actually I'm in training.
I'm racing for the local team against another team from the neighbouring town.
Sounds pretty cool.
Yeah, but I heard they were very good. Hence the training.
Well best of luck with that.
Thanks~
Well well, kind of cocky aren't we?
I suppose a little competition wouldn't hurt.
However I already finished my training for the day, so you'll have to challenge me another time.
How about right now then?
Wait wait. Swimming?
What's up Leo?
I don't want to get wet.
B-But Leo...
Well, I guess you did help me out before.
So Ill do it. But you better appreciate it. I hate getting wet.
Thanks Leo.
I'm not getting wet. No way no how.
(If only I had some way to get him to help.)
W-Well so much for that idea.
S-Sorry Melissa.
Don't worry about it.
Well let me know when you're ready then. 
OK guys, I feel like we need to take this seriously, otherwise there's no point.
OK I'll do my best!
You can count on me!
(Hmm. Gordon seems distracted.)
What? Oh yeah, sure.
...
Wow you guys did pretty good.
We...still...lost.
But I had to go all out just to stay ahead.
Maybe I should train with you guys more often.
After all that talk you didn't present much of a challenge.
It didn't seem like your hearts were really in it.
I-I'm sorry.
Well we better get out and dry off.
...
So was there anything else you wanted?
Ask what else she likes Sam
So er...
I actually recently got into Video games after playing a few my cousin brought over.
Oh so that's why you were in the store that time?
Yeah, buying something for myself.
Wait, is that the one that's so pink you need sunglasses to look at the box?
Er...yeah?
And you think it's my kind of game?
Erm...
Because I'm a girl?
Uh...I...
...
Ha ha, I'm just messing with you. 
But no, its not my kind of game.
Ha ha ha. You remembered.
It actually was.
Well sort of.
Sort of?
Yeah I wanted to get the same one my cousin had, but I couldn't remember the name.
And when I got there there were two 'Something' monster games. But apparently I picked the wrong one.
Ha ha ha ha.
Hey don't laugh. But actually this one is pretty fun too, so it worked out in the end I guess.
So which one did you get?
...
Still don't remember the name?
...no.
Haha.
Shush.
What's that?
Its a boo-t em up.
Oh I don't really like those, all the screen shaking gives me a headache.
Well its been fun hanging out with you guys, but I've got to head back.
Its especially nice to hear you talking so much Sam.
Wait...
Hmm?
Go for it Sam.
You can do it Sammy.
Melissa.
Yes?
W-Will you got out with me?
Like a date?
Y-Yes.
Hmm...
I'd be happy to.
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I think he's happy.
Ahahahaha. Good job hanging in there Sam.
I'm afraid I can't.
Y-You can't?
No, with the match coming up I can't afford to be distracted.
I'm sorry.
I-It's OK. I understand what you're saying.
Sam...
...
Lets go home guys.
...
...
...
...
We'll we better be off.
Okay, see you again sometime.
...
I-I messed up didn't I?
Yes.
There there Sammy.
Lets go home guys.
So to summarise...
Leon is together with Persephone
Leon is alone.
Gordon is together with Helen
Gordon is on his own
I am together with Melissa
I don't have anyone.
Looks like everything went according to plan.
Looks like I messed up somewhere.
And so everyone got someone of their own to be with.
Time for us to make triple dates a thing.
GOOD END
(Bonus chapter unlocked)
And so I ended up spending the rest of my life alone.
Well as alone as one can be while attached to two others...
BAD END
(Bonus chapter unlocked)
It seems there's nobody here...
(Come back after completing the game to learn more about the monsters that appear in it.)
Teach me Miss Melissa~
Ok, be seated class. Today we are going to be learning about different monsters.
What monsters?
Well the ones that appear in this particular story of course.
So what would you like to hear about first?
Hmm... I'm not really sure. Lets consult the manual.
The Chimera was, according to Greek mythology, a monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature, composed of the parts of three animals – a lion, a snake and a goat.
...sounds scary.
Our own Chimera isn't nearly as scary sounding as that.
Oh here they are now
Ok, lets count the heads to see if the book was correct.
1... The Lion, Leonardo
Hi
2... The Goat, Gordon
Hello Melissa.
3... The Snake, Samuel
Hi Melissa
Yes, it seems the book was correct. 3 heads.
But i have an important question guys.
What is it?
C-Can you really breathe fire?
Er...I dunno, can we?
Why are you asking me?
I cant say that I've tried it before.
...
...Maybe we should try it now?
...haaa
...paaa
...saaa
Well it looks like this might take a while so why don't we move on?
Medusa? You want to learn more about me?
I'm flattered~
I mean I could talk about myself all day long, but I'm kind of curious what the Manual says about me...
In Greek mythology Medusa was a monster, a Gorgon, generally described as having the face of a hideous human female with living venomous snakes in place of hair. Gazing directly into her eyes would turn onlookers to stone.
Whoa whoa. It says I'm hideous?!
I'm cute as a frigging button. I need to find out who wrote this book and give them a piece of my mind.
Maybe ill turn them to stone!
...wait, I don't think I can do that in real life.
Bah, this book sucks.
Anyway, lets move on kids.
Ahh the new girl, what was her name? Oh right Helen.
The Trusty Manual says...
In Greek mythology , harpies were female monsters in the form of birds with human faces. They steal food from their victims while they are eating and carry evildoers away. Their name means 'snatchers'.
I guess I need to be careful of my lunch when Helen is around.
Did someone say my name?
Oh hi Helen.
Hi Melissa.
You can't have my food.
What?
I'm keeping it.
...what?
...
...
Ok ill share some with you later.
I have no idea what's going on.
You'll have to come back later though, its not lunch time yet.
...Okaaay.
Wait is there even one of those in this?
Oh right, the shopkeeper. You guys don't miss a beat, do you?
Anyways the Manual says...
A Cyclops, in Greek mythology, was a member of a primordial race of giants, each with a single eye in the middle of his forehead.
I wonder if it makes it hard for them to judge distance, since they'd have no depth perception...
Oh I asked the shopkeeper if he'd pop over for this, but apparently he's busy selling games or something.
He's not that important anyway so don't worry about it.
So what next?
A human?
I don't need to consult the Manual this time. Everyone knows those don't exist.
What doesn't exist?
AHHHH!!!
...
Was it something I said?
...
I better get back, father will get worried.
...
...is it gone?
Who'd have thought they were actually real.
So what now?
Well I hope you remember all that, because its going to be on the test.
Class dismissed.
