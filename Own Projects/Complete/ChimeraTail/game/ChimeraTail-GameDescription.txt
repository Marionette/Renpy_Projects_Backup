Plot: 
Samuel is having a hard time with things. He is currently enamoured of the young Melissa who lives nearby, but each time he seemingly gets a chance to get closer to her the opportunity is spoiled by the interventions of his two brothers, Leonardo and Gordon, perhaps not always intentionally but generally because they are always around even when all he wants is some time alone. He needs to find a way to get them to work with him, or at least distract them enough for him to do what he needs to do to win the heart of his fair maiden. Its not easy being 1/3 of a chimera.
