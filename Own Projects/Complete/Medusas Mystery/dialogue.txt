*nods in unison*
[notgood].
[notgood] at all.
Pssst everyone wake up.
Huh? What is it?
Shhhh, don't wake Melissa
What's going on?
The [persistent.donut_spelling] has a bite missing.
Are you serious?!
Oh My God.
Melissa was looking forward to that [persistent.donut_spelling].
She specifically said not to touch it!
Who did it?
...
Unless the culprit turns themselves in we'll all be in trouble.
...
I guess we are doing this the hard way.
Detective Agnesss is on the case!
Don't get too excited, you're also a suspect!
Wha?!
Aren't you a suspect too?!
Like 'Saint Agnesss' would ever do anything interesting like that.
She's got a point, you being such a square and all.
...ANYWAYS!
Let's walk through the time leading up to the crime.
Ok so we arrived home at like 8pm
Which was later than usual...
...because Melissa just finished closing out that last case.
No crime can sneak past the watchful eye of Detective Melissa!
...except this one.
Ok, but like when she's awake.
Of course.
We're getting off track!
So after we got home Melissa took the [persistent.donut_spelling] out of the cupboard
She got it this morning from her favourite bakery
But when she sat at the table, the days' exhaustion hit her.
All of us really.
So we like decided to take a quick nap, like 10 minutes max.
But it's like 11pm now.
Yeah, I've no idea how, these chairs aren't that comfortable.
So we came home and slept in front of the [persistent.donut_spelling].
Pretty much.
Alright that covers the lead-up, next I need to look for clues.
Let's check out the crime scene!
Our victim, a delicious [persistent.donut_spelling], but with a large bite taken out of it.
The remains of a jam sandwich, whoever finished this off made a mess, there are crumbs everywhere.
Tomato Juice, Yuck. Only two snakes drink this stuff, probably because it looks like blood.
It's still dark out.
I don't think thats relevant to my investigation.
Why would I pick myself?
Let's interrogate the suspects!
Better let her sleep.
I'm gonna need more info to push this.
Nope.
Where's my lawyer?!
Calm down, this isn't one of your cop shows.
*sigh* Before I went to sleep I made a bet with Elissse, around 8:30, that I could go without eating for a whole day.
So obviously I couldn't have done it. Since I'm tough.
These crumbs!
I've no idea what you are talking about.
They look like sandwich crumbs
Elissse said she saw you eating a sandwich.
You got me. Guess I lose the bet, fair and square.
If you were sneaking food...
Fair. And. Square.
[ok2].
What are you saying?
Just trying to piece together what happened.
The only time I woke up was at around 10, and I saw Beatrisss and Francesssca sniffing around.
They were being mighty suspicious if you ask me.
Oh, what were they doing? 
I don't know, but they looked like they maybe finished eating or something.
The sprinkles on your face!
Must've fallen off the true culprit onto me!
I went to sleep at the same time as Elissse and Beatrisss. They were talking about eating or something.
Eating a [persistent.donut_spelling]?
I dunno, but like it was about how tough Beatrisss was or something. I didn't really get it.
The sweetness on your breath!
OH LOL, I was really hungry when we got back so I had a jam sandwich.
Jam sandwich?
Yeah!
...Right.
Oh I woke up later and I think saw Elissse and Francesssca arguing.
What time was this?
*shrugs* I was tired and went right back to sleep.
I was too busy fighting Ninjas to keep track. See this scar?
That you've drawn on yourself?
Ninjas.
They woke Francesssca, but I calmed her with a blood offering.
Blood?
Yes at 9:30, then she rested. She would need her strength for battles to come.
I'm just not gonna ask.
These sprinkles on your head!
No doubt placed there by THEM in an attempt to frame me!
Oh, I did see Daisssy eat a sandwich before we went to sleep.
Even saw Beatrisss finish it off!
We had an agreement where she would not eat to display her strength of will!
She failed!
Ugh, do I have to play along with this?
Just humor me.
*sigh* Elissse woke me up shouting about something stupid, as usual, at around 9:30.
As far as I could tell everyone was sleeping.
I got a drink and then went back to sleep.
Your Redish lips!
Really? That's the best you'd got?
It's Tomato Juice.
Yuck.
You have no taste.
I don't eat sweet things.
That's it?
That's it.
The culprit is...
Doing time for a crime I didn't commit? Classic.
All right you caught me!
You're picking me? So what do I win?
You've been sent by THEM to take me out, haven't you?!
Wow, you're really doing this. Ok.
...
*Gulp*
I'll take responsibility to spare the rest of you!
There is another option.
Really?
*whisper whisper*
You guys would do that for me?
Ok on the count of 3.
...3!
Ending 1: All for One!
We are going to turn you in as soon as Melissa wakes up.
Ending 2: In for a Penny...
Ending 3B: Falsely Accused (Oblivious)
Ending 3: Falsely Accused
The [persistent.donut_spelling]?
Well if this is how it's going to be.
[_name] lunges for the [persistent.donut_spelling] and takes a bite.
What are you doing?!
It's not long before the whole thing is gone.
The commotion wakes Melissa
What's going on?
...Where is my [persistent.donut_spelling]?
The only possible explanation is that Melissa ate it herself.
Oh?
Everyone's alibi checks out and we all know how much of a glutton she is...
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Is that so.
W-what I mean is...
Well then, oh great DETECTIVE...
If I ate it myself then why am I still hungry?
...
Hmmmmmmmm?!
Ending 4: A Bold Move, Let's see if it pays off.
Investigate!
Interrogate!
Accuse!
I'm [_text].
Wait...
Tell me what you did between 8pm and 11pm
Then how do you explain...
Anything else you'd like to say?
That's all
Actually...
Turn her in...
Or...
This is not good
