After discreetly asking around, Elara discovers Saria, the village witch, and sets out to find her. When Elara arrives at Saria's workshop, she is immediately impressed by the witch's knowledge and skill. Saria is initially wary of Elara, but the princess's sincerity and determination win her over.

Saria agrees to make a potion for the king, but only if Elara helps her gather the rare ingredients needed. Together, the two embark on a perilous journey through the forest, facing numerous challenges and dangers along the way. As they travel, Elara and Saria gradually begin to form a bond, despite their vastly different upbringings and personalities. Elara is fascinated by Saria's intelligence and talent, while Saria admires Elara's bravery and determination.

During their journey, Elara and Saria encounter obstacles that require them to work together, relying on each other's unique strengths and skills. They begin to develop a sense of mutual respect and trust, even as they struggle with their growing feelings for one another.

When they finally return to Saria's workshop with the ingredients, Saria brews the potion and gives it to Elara to deliver to the king. The potion works, and the king's health is restored.

The story begins with Princess Elara's father falling ill, and despite the efforts of the court's best physicians, his condition worsens day by day. Elara is desperate to find a cure for her father, but none of the physicians have been successful. One day, Elara overhears a group of courtiers discussing a witch who lives on the outskirts of the kingdom and who is rumored to have powerful healing abilities. Desperate to save her father, Elara sets out to find the witch, determined to convince her to create a potion that will save the king's life.

When Elara arrives at the witch's hut, she is surprised to find that the witch is a young woman named Saria. At first, Saria is hesitant to help Elara, as she knows the risks of practicing witchcraft and fears being caught. However, when she sees the desperation in Elara's eyes, Saria agrees to help her.

Over the following days, Elara visits Saria every day to check on the progress of the potion. As the two spend more time together, they begin to develop a friendship. Elara is fascinated by Saria's talent for potion-making and begins to learn more about the art herself. Saria, in turn, is impressed by Elara's determination and courage, as well as her skill with a sword.

As the days turn into weeks, Elara and Saria's friendship deepens into something more. Elara finds herself drawn to Saria's quiet strength and intelligence, and Saria is attracted to Elara's confidence and boldness. However, they both know that their love is forbidden, as same-sex relationships are not accepted in the kingdom.

Finally, after weeks of hard work, Saria is able to create a potion that she believes will cure the king's illness. Elara takes the potion back to the castle and gives it to the king. Miraculously, the potion works, and the king begins to recover.

Elara is hailed as a hero, and her father is grateful for her efforts to save his life. However, when Elara reveals her relationship with Saria, her father is outraged. He forbids Elara from seeing Saria and orders her to marry a prince from a neighboring kingdom.

Elara is torn between her love for Saria and her duty to her kingdom. She knows that she must make a choice, but it is a choice that will have consequences for both her and Saria. Will Elara choose duty or love, and what will become of her relationship with Saria?
