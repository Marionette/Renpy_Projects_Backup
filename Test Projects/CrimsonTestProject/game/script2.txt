    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by a number of candles and lanterns. Yandar is working behind the counter while a number of customers sit at tables or drink at the counter. Sitting on a stool at the counter is Player-Character (PC). A bard is playing a lute and singing in one corner of the room.

    #1. 
    player_narration "I entered the Golden Meadow and walked over to the counter, wincing as I took a seat on a vacant stool, my body stiff and sore. Although I was certain I'd sleep well tonight, a relaxing drink seemed in order first."

    #2. 
    player_narration "Gods knew I'd earned one after the day's training I'd endured at the Warriors' Guild. While I was generally happy with how I'd handled myself, Rimitar, the guildmaster, was a hard taskmaster."

    #3. 
    player_narration "While he was clearly extremely skilled in numerous disciplines and possessed a great deal of experience to share and knowledge to impart..."

    #4. 
    player_narration "...he expected nothing but the best from his pupils - and he had high standards. My aching bones and muscles could attest to that."

    #5. 
    player_narration "Trying to work the tension out of my neck, I looked around the inn. It was fairly busy, with most of the tables and stools being occupied, and the general buzz of conversation was overlapped by the singing and lute-playing of a bard seated in one corner."

    #6. 
    player_narration "Yandar was working behind the counter, and after he finished serving another customer, I caught his eye and he walked over to me."

    #7. 
    player_narration "The punishments of the day must have shown on me, because he looked me over, smiled and raised one eyebrow."

    #8. 
    yandar "Long day at the Warriors' Guild?"

    #9. 
    player_narration "I nodded, smiling wearily."

    #10. 
    player "Is it that obvious? An ale, please."

    #11. 
    player_narration "As Yandar poured my drink, he glanced over in the direction of the bard, who had just started a new song, an energetic and grand-sounding piece. Yandar chuckled."

    #12. 
    yandar "Well, there's good timing."

    #13. 
    player_narration "Unsure as to what Yandar meant, I looked at the bard and listened to him sing of a mighty warrior who was famed throughout Lyriathis, a noble hero who fought for justice."

    #14. 
    player_narration "I turned my attention back to Yandar. He handed me my drink and I paid him in return."

    #15. 
    player "Why's that?"

    #16. 
    yandar "You don't know the song? I'm surprised, seeing as it's about the lyrian who's been smacking your head in all day."

    #17. 
    player_narration "Looking once again at the bard, I listened further as he sang of the warrior who protected the innocent and the weak, battled evil wherever he found it, and generally did things you'd expect from some fabled, romantic hero."

    #18. 
    player_narration "I quickly looked back at Yandar - enjoying the accompanying twinge in my aching neck - and couldn't help but express my surprise."

    #19. 
    player "This song's about Rimitar?"

    #20. 
    yandar "Of course. He was very famous in his youth, travelling across all the lands, fighting in countless battles, performing heroic deeds, all that sort of thing. Assuming the stories are true, of course."

    #21. 
    yandar "True or not, as you can see, it's the kind of stuff that people write songs about."

    #22. 
    player "I had no idea."

    #23. 
    player_narration "Another customer gestured for service, and Yandar excused himself and walked away from me. I shook my head in surprise at what he'd told me, and frowned in thought as I took a long swallow of ale."

    #24. 
    player_narration "So Rimitar was some kind of hero who people sang and told stories about? The master of the Warriors' Guild spoke little about himself, but even so, I was surprised that this aspect of his life hadn't come through somehow during my time with him."

    #25. 
    player_narration "I had to admit to being curious to learn more. For now I'd settle for listening to the rest of the bard's song, but perhaps when I got the chance I'd ask the hero "

    #Location: Warriors' Guild, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside a training hall at the Warriors' Guild. It is daytime, the hall illuminated by daylight entering from outside. Player-Character (PC) stands just inside a doorway, watching Rimitar, the guildmaster, who is in the centre of the room.

    #1. 
    player_narration "I entered the main training hall of the Warriors' Guild to find it empty apart from Rimitar, although I could hear the muffled sounds of conversation and sparring coming from other rooms in the building."

    #2. 
    player_narration "Rimitar was practising with a sword in the centre of the room, the guildmaster darting and dodging this way and that, as if surrounded by several opponents, his sword thrusting and slicing through the air gracefully."

    #3. 
    player_narration "His expression was one of total focus, and he paid no attention to me as I watched him for a time, admiring the lyrian's skill."

    #4. 
    player_narration "Hearing the song about Rimitar being performed by the bard at the Golden Meadow had made me curious to learn more about the guildmaster's past, and watching him now, in full flow, only cemented that curiosity."

    #5. 
    player_narration "Something beyond Rimitar, on the opposite side of the room, caught my eye: a sword and shield hanging together in the centre of the wall."

    #6. 
    player_narration "I'd noticed the set before, but now the aged sword and shield - their metal chipped and tarnished in places but appearing no less impressive for it - took on newfound significance."

    #7. 
    player_narration "I knew they belonged to Rimitar, and I wondered what they'd seen over the years during his adventures, in how many battles they'd been used, what stories they could tell."

    #8. 
    player_narration "As I was staring at the sword and shield, Rimitar finally came to a stop, so I returned my attention to him. He lowered his sword and turned to look at me. I noticed that even after all of his exertion, he was barely breathing heavily."

    #9. 
    rimitar "Good morning, [PLAYER NAME]."

    #10. 
    player "Good morning, Master Rimitar. That was a very impressive display."

    #11. 
    player_narration "Rimitar didn't acknowledge the compliment, instead simply gesturing towards one of the weapon racks standing at the edge of the room."


    #12. 
    rimitar "We're going to be working with spears today, fetch two training spears from the rack."

    #13. 
    player_narration "I did as I was told while Rimitar placed the sword he'd been using back in its place in a different rack. I walked to the centre of the room and handed one of the wooden training spears to him while keeping the other for myself."

    #14. 
    player "Sir, I was wondering..."

    #15. 
    player "I recently heard that you had some incredible adventures when you were younger, things that people sing and tell stories about today."

    #16. 
    player "I was just wondering if you'd be willing to share some of those stories with me. I'd love to know more about them, and obviously hearing them from you would be best."

    #17. 
    player_narration "Rimitar stared at me in silence for a moment, his expression grave."

    #18. 
    rimitar "The past is a thing best left buried. You should no sooner disturb it than you would any other corpse."

    #19. 
    player_narration "As if his words didn't make it clear enough, Rimitar raised his spear and pointed it at me: he wasn't interested in sharing tales of his past with me, we were here to fight, not talk."

    #20. 
    player_narration "Although I was disappointed, I tried to put it from my mind and "

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Player-Character (PC) stands before the main desk, standing behind which is Belawen, the head librarian.

    #1. 
    player_narration "The City Library was fittingly quiet as I entered the main room of the building, my footfalls sounding loud to my own ears in the huge, hushed space around me as I walked over to the main desk."

    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd been carrying two books which I now placed on the surface of the desk, intending to return them. There were a few stacks of books already on the desk, along with a thick ledger."

    #3. 
    player_narration "The head librarian, Belawen, was working behind the desk, sorting through one of the stacks while making notes in the ledger.  As I put down my own books, she looked up from her work and smiled at me."

    #4. 
    belawen "Good morning."

    #5. 
    player "Morning. I'm just returning these."

    #6. 
    player_narration "Belawen picked up the books and glanced at each of the two covers before putting them to one side, then her gaze returned to me."

    #7. 
    belawen "That's fine, thank you."

    #8. 
    player_narration "I smiled politely and turned to leave, but then paused and turned back as I heard Belawen begin to speak again."

    #9. 
    belawen "You, uh, wouldn't happen to be on your way to the Warriors' Guild, would you?"

    #10. 
    player_narration "Before I could reply, Belawen's eyes widened slightly and she seemed to catch herself, embarrassed, as if I might have taken offence."

    #11. 
    belawen "I don't mean to pry, of course, it's just that I've happened to see you going in there a couple of times."

    #12. 
    player "It's fine. Why do you ask?"

    #13. 
    belawen "I have some books which were supposed to be delivered to Guildmaster Rimitar today, but I'm afraid I'm swamped with work here and there's no one else in who can do it."

    #14. 
    belawen "I realise it's a bit presumptuous, so if you can't then of course I understand."

    #15. 
    player "No, it's no problem, I can do that."

    #16. 
    belawen "Oh, marvelous, thank you very much."

    #17. 
    player_narration "Belawen turned towards one of the stacks of books on the desk and carefully pulled out three particular books. She held them out to me."

    #18. 
    belawen "There we are. If you could pass these on to the guildmaster then I really would be very grateful."

    #19. 
    player_narration "I looked down at the books, moving them in my hands so as to see the cover of each one, and as I did so I frowned, puzzled."

    #20. 
    player_narration "Because if I'd had to guess as to what kind of books Rimitar would be taking out of the library then I'd have assumed they would be books involving combat or weaponry or something along those lines."

    #21. 
    player_narration "Not three volumes of love poems, which were what I held in my hands now. I looked up from the books and at Belawen, who smiled at the surprised expression which I was unable to keep from my face."

    #22. 
    belawen "You seem surprised."

    #23. 
    player "I am. I don't know Rimitar very well, but considering what he's like during the time I do spend with him... well, let's just say I didn't take him for a fan of love poetry."

    #24. 
    belawen "Oh yes. I know he's very quiet and brooding - and a hard teacher, by all accounts - but Rimitar isn't just a fan of poetry, he used to write it himself many years ago."

    #25. 
    belawen "Some of his pieces never received proper printings and so have been lost to time, sadly. If Rimitar does still have copies of them then he's not interested in sharing them."

    #26. 
    belawen "But I've read everything of his that I've been able to get my hands on, and to be frank, he's written poetry which would put some so-called masters of the form to shame."

    #27. 
    belawen "Most of his poems are about love, although a few are more adventurous and heroic in nature. All of them are wonderful."

    #28. 
    player "If he was so good at it, why did he stop? And why doesn't he want to share his poetry with anyone anymore?"

    #29. 
    player_narration "Belawen glanced around and hesitated, as if unsure about saying aloud what she had in mind. After a moment she leaned in towards me and spoke in a slightly quieter voice."

    #30. 
    belawen "Rimitar has never spoken of it, and no one else seems to be able to say for certain, but I have a theory."

    #31. 
    belawen "No lyrian could have written love poetry the likes of which Rimitar wrote without having been in love himself. To just suddenly stop in the way he did, to turn away from his gift like that..."

    #32. 
    belawen "I can't help but think that whoever it was that he loved so deeply, he must have lost her, and that's what changed him: a broken heart. It's tragic."

    #33. 
    player_narration "I nodded, thinking about Rimitar. First I learn that he used to be some famed hero, now this. There really was a lot more to that lyrian than met the eye."

    #34. 
    player "Alright, I best be off. I'll see that Rimitar receives these books."

    #35. 
    player_narration "Belawen thanked me again and I turned and left the library through the main entrance, my curiosity concerning Rimitar stronger than ever. (END OF "

    #● We are inside a training hall at the Warriors' Guild. It is daytime, the hall illuminated by daylight entering from outside. Player-Character (PC) and Guildmaster Rimitar stand facing each other in the centre of the room.

    #1. 
    player_narration "Although part of me was distracted by the rumours concerning an apparent upcoming war between Lyriathis and Dahraith, I'd tried to keep my mind on the here-and-now during my latest training session at the Warriors' Guild."

    #2. 
    player_narration "Besides, absolute focus was a necessity when you were sparring with Guildmaster Rimitar - if you wanted to avoid getting absolutely battered, anyway."

    #3. 
    player_narration "As we finished a round of sparring with some wooden training swords, Rimitar called a five-minute break, although I was the only one who really needed to get my breath back."

    #4. 
    player_narration "After I'd managed to do that, and despite Rimitar's typically terse nature, I decided to take the opportunity to speak to him before we got back to the training."

    #5. 
    player "Sir? I take it you've heard the rumours going around about war breaking out between us and the Dahris...?"

    #6. 
    player_narration "I paused, waiting for an answer, but none came as Rimitar placed the training swords we'd been using back in their rack. I pressed on."

    #7. 
    player "I was just wondering what you thought about it. Do you really think it'll happen? If it did, do you think Lyriathis would win?"

    #8. 
    player_narration "Having returned the swords, Rimitar walked back over to me unarmed. He came to a stop and looked at me with his usual grave expression."

    #9. 
    rimitar "There are never any real winners in war, [PLAYER NAME]. Some people live, some die, many suffer. Whatever happens, I'll have no part of it."

    #10. 
    player_narration "Something seemed to occur to Rimitar, and his eyes narrowed slightly, his expression taking on a more questioning, piercing aspect."

    #11. 
    rimitar "Tell me, what do you actually know about Dahraith? About the Dahris?"

    #12. 
    player "Well, I - "

    #13. 
    rimitar "Not as much as you think you do, I'd wager. Few Lyris do."

    #14. 
    rimitar "No doubt you were told the same as everyone else growing up: tales of the evil Dahris, our ancient and hated enemy, the dark and wicked counterpart to the more civilised and morally upright Lyris..."

    #15. 
    rimitar "Life is very, very rarely that simple. The Dahris are not monsters, they're people, just like us, with all of the qualities and flaws that make people everywhere - whatever their race - what they are."

    #16. 
    player "You sound like you're very familiar with them. Do you know any Dahris well, then?"

    #17.

    #8. 
    rimitar "Your training was progressing satisfactorily. But if you have to leave then good luck."

    #9. 
    player_narration "I was sure that was as close as Rimitar was going to come to a compliment and an emotional farewell, so I didn't waste any time in bringing up the offer I'd had in mind."

    #10. 
    player "Thank you, guildmaster."

    #11. 
    player "Actually, I was thinking about what you told me before, about the Dahris mage you used to know..."

    #12. 
    player_narration "Rimitar tensed very slightly but said nothing as he waited for me to continue."



    #13. 
    player "And I was just wondering if you'd like me to keep an ear out for any news of her on my travels. I know you said it was a long time ago, and that you searched for her yourself, but... well, I just thought I'd offer."

    #14. 
    player_narration "Rimitar stared at me, tense but also seemingly unsure of how to react to my suggestion. Eventually he gave a small sigh and looked away."

    #15. 
    rimitar "I appreciate the offer, but it would be pointless. It wasn't just a long time ago, it was a lifetime ago. I've changed since then."

    #16. 
    rimitar "And besides, if I couldn't find her back then - and gods know I tried so hard - I fail to see how you'd be able to do so now after all these years and with nothing to go on."

    #17. 
    player "I understand all that, sir. But there's no harm in it, is there? I mean, you've got nothing to lose by letting me try, seeing as I'm already going to be travelling anyway..."

    #19. 
    rimitar "Wait there."

    #20. 
    player_narration "Rimitar turned and walked over to his sword-and-shield set which hung on the wall. He placed the two swords he'd been holding in a nearby rack, reached one hand behind the shield and withdrew something which he held as he returned to me."

    #21. 
    player_narration "Rimitar held out the object to me, and I looked down at it as I reached for it: it was an old and tattered envelope, still sealed."

    #22. 
    rimitar "I wrote this letter years ago, after I'd given up on my search for Hellaren. Those were... dark days. Even though I'd resigned myself to never seeing her again, part of me thought maybe writing the letter would help."

    #23. 
    rimitar "It didn't. I've almost thrown it into the fire a hundred times, but could never bring myself to do it."

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. Specifically we are in one of the guest rooms on one of the upper floors of the building, the room illuminated by daylight entering through its single window. Standing inside the room is the dahrian named Elyndir. Standing together in the room's open doorway are Player-Character and Meda, the tavern-owner.

    #1. 
    player_narration "Belgran's streets were bustling, the city crowded due to the festival currently being celebrated here - everywhere you turned Granians were singing, laughing, drinking, playing games, and generally enjoying themselves."

    #2. 
    player_narration "After having slowly made my way through several busy streets, I entered the Moon and Sabre to find the place packed with yet more celebrating Granians."

    #3. 
    player_narration "I squeezed my way through the crowd and over to the bar where Meda was serving drinks. After a minute or so I managed to catch her eye, and after serving her current customer, she walked over to me and greeted me with a smile."

    #4. 
    player_narration "I asked for the key to my room, and her smile faltered. She said that the room was no longer available, that the tavern was in fact fully booked due to the festival."

    #5. 
    player_narration "She apologised for not warning me in advance and claimed that every other inn and guest-house in Belgran would also be full by now. However, there was one thing she might be able to offer me, she added."

    #6. 
    player_narration "Apparently one of the rooms upstairs was being rented by a fellow Lyris - Meda said I could share the room with him if I liked, and that this was the best she could do."

    #7. 
    player_narration "Although I was initially hesitant at the thought of sharing a room with a complete stranger, if everywhere else really was fully booked as well then I wondered if this was perhaps an offer I should accept."

    #8. 
    player_narration "Also, I had to admit to missing Lyriathis, so perhaps meeting a new, fellow Lyris here in this foreign place might not be such a bad thing."

    #9. 
    player_narration "I told Meda I'd take her up on her offer. Smiling again now, she walked out from behind the bar and led me upstairs."


    #10 P
    LAYER NARRATION: We came to a stop before the door of the room which she had in mind. She knocked and then, before anyone could answer, turned the handle.

    #11. 
    player_narration "Meda opened the door wide and we stepped through the doorway together. A moment later I suddenly stopped in my tracks as I saw the room's occupant: it was no Lyris, but a Dahris!"

    #12. 
    player_narration "Specifically a dahrian, one who seemed to be around the same age as Olin. He glanced at Meda before looking at me, a flicker of surprise appearing on his face as he did so."

    #13. 
    player_narration "After a couple of seconds of us holding each other's gaze, the dahrian broke eye contact and looked once again at Meda, clearly waiting for an explanation."

    PART A

    #Location: A street somewhere in Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are on a street somewhere in Belgran. It is night and the street is quiet. Player-Character (PC) walks along the street, alone, until he is confronted by a gang of three criminals.

    #1. 
    player_narration "Belgran's recent festival was now a memory, and while thoughts of the day occasionally popped into my head, one thing in particular had remained: Elyndir, the dahrian who I'd ended up sharing a room with at the Moon and Sabre."

    #2. 
    player_narration "While we were no longer sharing a room - within a couple of days of the end of the festival, the inns and guest-houses of Belgran once again had rooms available - both of us were still staying at the Moon and Sabre."

    #3. 
    player_narration "I was glad I'd chosen not to let any inherent mistrust of the Dahris stop me from staying with Elyndir and getting to know him, as he turned out to be a likeable enough dahrian, albeit one who could be quite cutting when he chose to be."

    #4. 
    player_narration "I suspected there was more to him beneath the surface, however, something driving him but which he kept to himself - he could be secretive, and there was an intensity to him which flared up at times."

    #5. 
    player_narration "Although I'd tried to subtly question him about his past, his purpose in  Belgran and other details about himself, he always managed to avoid the question somehow. "

    #6. 
    player_narration "Also, he often left the Moon and Sabre at night, quietly exiting his room and being gone from the tavern for up to hours at a time."

    #7. 
    player_narration "The first time I'd noticed this had been by accident, but then I made a point of listening out for it on following nights. Unsurprisingly, Elyndir never mentioned his nocturnal jaunts to me."

    #8. 
    player_narration "Although part of me thought I should just mind my own business and that I was only being suspicious of Elyndir because he was a Dahris..."

    #9. 
    player_narration "...another part of me couldn't help but wonder if his outward personality was all a façade, a mask he wore to hide his true self. Ultimately I still didn't really know anything about him, after all."



    #10. 
    player_narration "In the end, my curiosity got the better of me. Earlier tonight I'd made a point of staying awake until eventually, as I hoped I might, I once again heard Elyndir quietly leaving the Moon and Sabre. Trying to be quieter still, I followed him."

    #11. 
    player_narration "The night air was cold and the wind piercing as I slipped out of the tavern, the surrounding streets dark and empty - apart from Elyndir, who I saw move into an alley down the street. Keeping my distance and sticking to the shadows, I continued to follow."

    #12. 
    player_narration "Pursuing Elyndir took me through a number of Belgran's quieter streets and alleys - wherever the dahrian was going, apparently he wanted to get there in as discreet a fashion as possible."

    #13. 
    player_narration "Occasionally I saw Granians out and about, alone or in pairs at most. We ignored one another, the hood I wore up over my head hiding my noteworthy nature as a Lyris."

    #14. 
    player_narration "A few times I thought Elyndir might have realised that someone was following him, but every time he stopped and paused, eventually he always pressed on again."

    #15. 
    player_narration "After following Elyndir around one particular street corner, I suddenly  found he was nowhere to be seen. I moved in the direction he'd have most likely taken but was greeted by nothing but empty cobbles."

    #16. 
    player_narration "I doubled back, tried a nearby alley, but met with the same result. I scanned my surroundings: nothing. I cursed and accepted that I'd lost him."

    #17. 
    player_narration "Even so, I wasn't ready to give up completely, and so I spent the next twenty minutes searching the surrounding streets and alleys, trying to remain discreet while keeping an eye out for Elyndir."

    #18. 
    player_narration "But my searching turned out to be fruitless, and I was standing alone in an empty alley when I reluctantly decided to give up and return to the Moon and Sabre. It seemed Elyndir's secrets would remain hidden from me for now."

    #19. 
    player_narration "I turned to leave the alley only to see a cloaked and hooded figure appear from around the corner and stand before me, blocking the alley mouth."

    #20. 
    player_narration "Due to the darkness, the figure's clothing and the distance between us, I couldn't really make out any details, although the fact that they stood in silence, facing me and blocking the alley at that end instantly put me on edge."

    #21. 
    player_narration "Tense but trying to appear calm, I turned around and began walking in the opposite direction. I soon stooped, however, when a second person - also cloaked and hooded - appeared from around the corner ahead."

    #22. 
    player_narration "Like the first person, the newcomer stood at the end of the alley, facing me and blocking my exit. So this was how it was going to be."

    #23. 
    player_narration "Movement in one corner of my eye caused me to turn my head towards a smaller, adjoining alley which would have been my one remaining exit - if a third shadowy figure hadn't just appeared there, standing and watching me like the others."

    #24. 
    player_narration "I moved slowly, trying to keep all three people within my field of vision, breathing slowly and mentally preparing myself for what was about to happen. The first figure began walking towards me, and the other two followed his lead."


    #25. 
    player_narration "I turned so that I was facing across the alley and in the direction of the third figure. I backed up a few steps. I quickly looked over my surroundings, hoping to spot some other way out which I'd missed, but there was nothing."

    #26. 
    player_narration "When the three cloaked and hooded figures came to within about ten feet of me, surrounding me, they stopped. I still couldn't make out much of their features or even tell what they race they were, although all three seemed to be male."

    #27. 
    player_narration "Apart from a few distant, scattered sounds - a dog barking, someone coughing, a wooden sign creaking in the wind - the night was silent. My three assailants made no sound and said no words as they drew their knives."

    #28. 
    player_narration "I took a slow, deep breath and got ready."

    #29. 
    elyndir "Back away. [He's / She's] with me."

    #30. 
    player_narration "The three figures and I looked towards the alley from which the third of them had emerged only to see Elyndir standing there now, watching us with a hard frown. His eyes roamed over the people surrounding me."

    #31. 
    elyndir "The Lyris is my partner. I wanted [him / her] to shadow me tonight as a test of [his / her] skills."

    #32. 
    elyndir "Touch [him/ her] and you and I are going to have a problem, and I'd hate to see our relationship sour so soon."

    #33. 
    player_narration "The three figures glanced at each other before their eyes moved back to Elyndir. One of them - I knew him to be a Granian now, judging by his voice - spoke with an annoyed, accusatory edge."

    #34. 
    cloaked_granian "You never said anything about a partner."

    #35. 
    elyndir "I didn't see the need. Frankly, I wasn't expecting [him / her] to run into you fine gentlemen."

    #36. 
    elyndir "But now we're all clear on things, so if you'd put away the knives and leave me to have a talk with my partner? Alone?"

    #37. 
    player_narration "The men looked at each other again before seemingly coming to a silent agreement - they slowly lowered their knives and backed away from me. Even so, I remained ready to defend myself."

    #38. 
    player_narration "The man who'd spoken previously looked at me and then at Elyndir."

    #39. 
    cloaked_granian "Alright, then. But you and your partner should be more careful in future, whether you're walking down dark alleys or keeping secrets from people you're supposed to be working with. Both of those things can turn out very nasty..."

    #40. 
    cloaked_granian "See you soon, Dahris."

    #41. 
    player_narration "The man had apparently said his piece, and didn't wait for any kind of reply from Elyndir. He turned and began walking down the alley, his two colleagues following him."

    #42. 
    player_narration "They moved calmly and quietly, pocketing their knives once more as they went. Eventually they disappeared around the corner."

    #43. 
    player_narration "Although I couldn't help but relax a little, I remained on edge due to the continued presence of Elyndir, whose gaze was focused on me now, his expression serious. I looked back, waiting for him to make the first move."

    #44. 
    player_narration "To my surprise, one corner of Elyndir's mouth lifted in a smile."

    #45. 
    elyndir "A curious one, aren't you. Come with me, maybe I'll give you some of the answers you're looking for."

    #46. 
    player_narration "With that, Elyndir turned around and began walking back into the alley from which he'd emerged."

    #47. 
    player_narration "I paused, wondering if I should follow him or if perhaps the more sensible option was to walk off alone in a different direction and back to the Moon and Sabre, and to forget my curiosity regarding the dahrian."

    #48. 
    player_narration "I followed Elyndir into the alley. (GO TO PART B)"





































    PART B

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is quiet, with only a few scattered men drinking as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is the young man who works as Meda's assistant. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir are sitting together at a table in a corner of the room.

    #1. 
    player_narration "After my encounter with the three cut-throats who'd cornered me after I lost Elyndir, the dahrian had led me back to the Moon and Sabre. When I demanded answers, he said we'd talk over a drink."

    #2. 
    player_narration "At this late hour, Meda was in bed, the handful of customers scattered around the tavern being served by the young man who worked part-time as her assistant."

    #3. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I walked up to the counter and he ordered an ale. When it arrived, I took the tankard for myself, raised it and took a long swallow. Elyndir turned to look at me, raising one eyebrow. "

    #4. 
    player_narration "I set down the tankard but kept it in my hand as I looked back at him with a flat expression. After my meeting with his charming, knife-wielding friends, I figured Elyndir owed me a drink. He ordered another ale for himself."

    #5. 
    player_narration "Elyndir led me to a table in a quiet corner of the room, a spot far enough away from everyone else that our conversation wouldn't be overheard. He took a drink and then looked at me with a serious expression."

    #6. 
    elyndir "Now listen: if I'm going to share these details with you then as far as I'm concerned, there's no going back - for you."

    #7. 
    elyndir "I'd be placing my trust in you, and that is not something I do lightly. Nor is it something I'd forgive if the person I trusted betrayed me. Do you understand?"

    #8. 
    elyndir "But it's your choice. If you don't want to get involved any further then say so now. We'll finish these drinks and say no more about it."

    #9. 
    elyndir "So which is it?"

    #10. 
    player_narration "Given what I'd seen of the type of people Elyndir worked with, part of me immediately insisted that becoming further involved with the dahrian was a terrible idea which could get me into very serious trouble."

    #11. 
    player_narration "But even so, that curiosity which had been strong enough to see me sneaking out after dark and following Elyndir through the city hadn't disappeared. I thought about it as I drank some of my ale."

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and talking as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir are sitting together at a table in a corner of the room. In another corner of the room, playing a lute and singing, is a bard.

    #1. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I sat together at a table in a corner of the Moon and Sabre, each drinking an ale and talking occasionally about this and that."

    #2. 
    player_narration "The warmth and light of the tavern was welcome after the time we'd spent out on the cold, dark streets of Belgran earlier in the evening due to a job which Elyndir had agreed to do - a job on which I accompanied him thanks to my new status as his partner."

    #3. 
    player_narration "Given my previous encounter with Elyndir's three knife-wielding acquaintances, naturally I'd been wary of what the job would entail, expecting something dangerous."

    #4. 
    player_narration "But in the end it had turned out to be quite pedestrian, Elyndir and I only being required to deliver a sealed package to an unnamed man at the back door of a particular shop..."

    #5. 
    player_narration "...and to take another package from him, which we were to then deliver to another unnamed man at a different location. It was from the second man that Elyndir received the second half of our payment, the first half having been demanded up-front."

    #6. 
    player_narration "I asked Elyndir what the packages contained but he said he didn't know - or care. I didn't know if he was telling the truth or not but either way I didn't press the issue. "

    #7. 
    player_narration "We hadn't spoken about the job - or future jobs, or anything else concerning our new partnership - since arriving at the Moon and Sabre, instead just chatting amiably as we often did."

    #8. 
    player_narration "A Granian bard was sitting in another corner of the room, playing a lute and singing, and his performance was pleasant enough but not something I was paying a lot of attention to."



    #9. 
    player_narration "That changed, however, when he suddenly began playing a familiar song, one which took me a few seconds to recognise, but then it hit me: it was the song written about Rimitar, which I'd heard for the first time in the Golden Meadow in Lyr-Taer."

    #10. 
    player_narration "Although I didn't think this Granian bard was as talented as the lyrian I'd seen perform in the Golden Meadow, he gave a decent enough performance and carried the song well. I turned to Elyndir."

    #11. 
    player "You might not believe this, but do you remember when we first met and I mentioned a lyrian named Rimitar? My teacher at the Warriors' Guild in Lyr-Taer?"

    #12. 
    player_narration "I waited for some kind of response but Elyndir - who was frowning now, I noticed - simply looked back at me in silence. Undaunted, I continued."

    #13. 
    player "Well, this song is actually about him. Really. He used to be a famous adventurer, travelling all over the lands, fighting evil wherever he found it, all that sort of thing."

    #14. 
    player "I suppose some people must know him in Grana as well as in Lyriathis, otherwise I doubt this bard would be playing the song."

    #15. 
    player_narration "Elyndir was looking off across the room with the same frown on his face, and didn't look back at me as he grunted dismissively and then spoke."

    #16. 
    elyndir "The noble, flawless Lyris hero fighting for justice and protecting the innocent... what a lovely fairytale."

    #17. 
    player "Well, some of it's exaggerated or missing things, no doubt. I know he travelled with a group of companions for a time, and this song doesn't mention them."

    #18. 
    player "Actually, you might be interested to hear that one of them was a Dahris. A dahria mage, to be specific."

    #19. 
    player_narration "Elyndir turned his gaze on me now and he didn't look interested, he looked angry, even if only for a moment. Then he lifted his tankard, drained the remaining ale in several long swallows, and stood up. He nodded at my own tankard."

    #20. 
    elyndir "Another one?"

    #21. 
    player "No, I'm alright, I've still got about half left."

    #22. 
    player_narration "Elyndir walked off towards the counter without another word, and I wondered what was bothering him."

    #23. 
    player_narration "Was it the fact that no Dahris companion was mentioned in the legend of Rimitar as portrayed in this song and probably other tales? I doubted it, Elyndir had never struck me as the type to care about something like that."

    #24. 
    player_narration "Whatever it was, I decided not to push him on the subject. As I waited for Elyndir to return, I sat and drank and listened to the bard as he continued singing of "

    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and talking as they sit at tables or at the bar. Working behind the bar is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir are sitting together at a table in a corner of the room.

    #1. 
    player_narration "As I entered the main room of the Moon and Sabre, I stopped as I spotted Elyndir sitting alone at the bar, staring into the tankard he held in one hand."

    #2. 
    player_narration "My surprise didn't come from seeing Elyndir drinking in the tavern but rather that he hadn't invited me to have a drink with him as he usually did. I walked over to the bar and took a seat on the empty stool next to him."

    #3. 
    player_narration "Meda was working and I asked her for an ale. As she poured my drink, I looked over at Elyndir, who only glanced at me before returning his attention to his tankard, his expression thoughtful."

    #14. 
    player "So...?"

    #15. 
    player_narration "Elyndir turned in my direction and finally gave me his full attention. He lowered his voice slightly although the tavern wasn't particularly busy, with no one close enough to overhear us."

    #16. 
    elyndir "There's a new group of smugglers in town. A rough bunch, by all accounts. And arrogant."

    #17. 
    elyndir "Apparently these smugglers have decided that, unlike most other sensible criminals in Belgran, they don't need to pay a cut of their profits to the Thieves' Guild."

    #18. 
    elyndir "Needless to say, this hasn't sat well with the guild. They want to make an example of these smugglers. And they're offering a handsome reward to anyone willing to do just that."

    #Location: Smugglers' Warehouse, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are inside a warehouse somewhere in Belgran. It is night, the only illumination coming from the moonlight which enters through several high windows. There are a number of crates of various types stacked around the room. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir have broken into the warehouse and are now stealthily exploring it. There is no one else in sight.

    #1. 
    player_narration "After I'd agreed to help Elyndir put the new group of smugglers in Belgran out of business, he continued learning what he could about the newcomers while at the same time being careful not to make them aware of his interest."

    #2. 
    player_narration "He'd also informed the Thieves' Guild of his intentions, but of course they were more interested in results than intentions, so Elyndir had to actually get the job done before he'd gain any favour with the guild."

    #3. 
    player_narration "He eventually came to me with the location of the back-alley warehouse out of which the smugglers seemed to be operating."

    #4. 
    player_narration "Also, although he was confident they'd brought in their latest shipment as he'd heard they would, he hadn't been able to find out what this shipment consisted of."

    #5. 
    player_narration "Elyndir's plan was simple. The two of us would infiltrate the warehouse at night and see what we could learn about the smugglers and their goods."

    #6. 
    player_narration "If the situation presented itself, we'd put an end to the smugglers and their operation there and then. If not, we'd at least have gathered more information on our targets."

    #7. 
    player_narration "After quietly forcing open the door at the rear of the warehouse, Elyndir and I slipped inside, moving as stealthily as possible, sticking to the darkness."

    #8. 
    player_narration "We'd watched the exterior of the building for a time before making our move but hadn't seen any sign of the smugglers, and the place was still and silent inside as well."

    #9. 
    player_narration "We moved along a couple of corridors, checking rooms as we passed them, but discovered nothing out of the ordinary."


    #10. 
    player_narration "Then we came to the main room which made up the bulk of the warehouse, the large, open space filled with stacks of wooden crates and barrels of varying size and design."

    #11. 
    player_narration "The room was dark and, due to the crates and barrels, contained a lot of blind spots. Elyndir leaned towards me and spoke in a whisper."

    #12. 
    elyndir "I don't like it. Where the hell are the guards?"

    #13.

    #17.3.
    player_narration "Also, only now did I see that Elyndir and I weren't alone in the warehouse after all. I noticed a cloaked and hooded figure standing off to one side of me, in the shadows, his hands gesturing as he cast some kind of spell. A mage. "#(GO TO 17.4.)

    #18.3.

    #Location: A street somewhere in Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are on a street somewhere in Belgran. It is night and the street is quiet. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir have been walking along the street but now stop as they are confronted by a group of four cloaked and hooded figures.

    #1. 
    player_narration "It was after midnight as Elyndir and I walked the chilly and dark Belgran streets. We'd met up earlier and were now on our way to meet a contact of Elyndir's, a man he wanted information from."

    #2. 
    player_narration "We'd kept a low profile since the night we broke into the smugglers' warehouse, but now Elyndir had finally had enough and decided to take action, with me along for the ride."

    #3. 
    player_narration "Wearing our hoods up over our heads, we kept to the smaller streets, which were quiet, only a few scattered Granians passing us in silence along the way."

    #4. 
    player_narration "We were walking along a narrow alley lined by buildings when two cloaked and hooded figures stepped out of the shadows ahead of us and stood facing us, blocking our path. Elyndir and I stopped."

    #5. 
    player_narration "A moment later, two more figures appeared behind us, blocking that way as well. We were trapped, and neither of us had seen it coming. We held our ground, tense but calm, waiting to see who'd make the first move."

    #6. 
    player_narration "I was wondering if these were simply common thieves or if they had specifically targeted Elyndir and I when one of the two ahead of us approached and answered my question for me."

    #7. 
    salys "Elyndir... it's been a long time."

    #8. 
    player_narration "The figure stopped before he got too close, and lowered his hood to reveal the face of a dahrian. He had a thin smile on his lips as he looked at Elyndir."

    #9. 
    player_narration "I glanced over at Elyndir, who was looking back at the dahrian with an expression of recognition. But while Elyndir seemed to know him, he certainly didn't look happy to see him."

    #10. 
    elyndir "Salys. I heard you were dead. I should've known you'd crawl out from under yet another rock eventually."


    #11. 
    salys "You can't keep a good dahrian down, Elyndir. And is that any way to greet an old friend?"

    #12. 
    elyndir "I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. Let's not waste each other's time pretending otherwise, eh?"

    #13. 
    player_narration "Salys' smile disappeared, although he retained the confidence and composure of someone who has his enemy trapped and outnumbered."

    #14. 
    salys "Alright. You stole something very important. Some weapons. It's my job to retrieve them."

    #15. 
    player_narration "Elyndir barked an abrupt, mocking laugh and shook his head."

    #16. 
    elyndir "You're a member of the new smuggling gang in Belgran? How the mighty have fallen. And here I thought those smugglers might be something worth worrying about..."

    #17. 
    salys "I'm no smuggler. You're the common criminal, Elyndir, not me. I'm helping to keep my country and its people safe."

    #18. 
    elyndir "Salys, the noble and heroic patriot... don't make me laugh."

    #19. 
    salys "As fond as I've always been of our chats, I think I've already wasted enough time on you. You stole from the wrong people, and now you face the consequences."

    #20. 
    salys "Although perhaps my friends and I could see our way to going easy on you... if you return all of the weapons to us right now."

    #21. 
    elyndir "I have no idea what weapons you're talking about."

    #22. 
    player_narration "Salys turned his attention to me."

    #23. 
    salys "Maybe you've got the sense to be more talkative. Why don't you lower your hood so we can get a good look at the face of Elyndir's friend?"

    #2.

    #3. 
    player_narration "Elyndir had never showed much interest in magic since I'd known him, so part of me had expected him to quickly become bored and impatient, but to his credit he'd been a good pupil so far. Although it was still early days, of course."

    #6. 
    player_narration "Despite that help, however, within minutes of his visit earlier today it became obvious that Olin didn't approve of Elyndir or his being here, my brother's manner being curt and suspicious."

    #Location: A forest clearing, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in a clearing somewhere in a forest in Lyriathis. It is sometime during the day. Rimitar and Elyndir stand facing each other while Player-Character (PC) stands between them and off to one side.

    #1. 
    player_narration "The journey which Rimitar and I had taken together from Lyr-Taer came to an end as we entered the forest clearing where I'd arranged for Elyndir to meet us."

    #2. 
    player_narration "Rimitar and I had spoken about various subjects during our journey, but his past was still something he didn't like to talk about much."

    #3. 
    player_narration "And during the final few hours of our journey, Rimitar had barely spoken at all, the upcoming meeting with the dahrian who seemed to be his son no doubt weighing heavier and heavier on his mind as we neared our destination."

    #4. 
    player_narration "Elyndir stood in the centre of the clearing, waiting for us, his face expressionless as he watched us approach. As for Rimitar, his brow was furrowed in a thoughtful frown as he studied Elyndir."

    #5. 
    player_narration "We came to a stop about ten feet away from Elyndir, he and Rimitar directly facing each other while I stood slightly off to one side, not wanting to get between them. They looked at each other in silence."

    #6. 
    player "Elyndir, meet Rimitar."

    #7. 
    player "Rimitar, this is my friend Elyndir."

    #8. 
    elyndir "Bastard!"

    #9. 
    player_narration "Elyndir's furious, hissed insult in Rimitar's direction came at the same time as he lunged forward and drew his sword, the rage on his face making it instantly clear that he intended to kill the guildmaster."

    #10. 
    player_narration "Rimitar's reflexes were incredibly sharp, however, and whatever he might have been expecting of Elyndir just moments before, now the dahrian was an immediate threat, and Rimitar had plenty of experience dealing with those."

    #11. 
    player_narration "Rimitar drew his own sword just in time to block Elyndir's first attack, and the guildmaster then remained on the defensive as Elyndir's rage fuelled his offence, the dahrian swinging and thrusting his sword as Rimitar blocked and dodged."


    #12. 
    player_narration "As for me, I was momentarily frozen to the spot in shock. What the hell was Elyndir doing?"

    #13. 
    elyndir "I'll kill you for all the pain you've caused me and my mother, you coward!"

    #14. 
    rimitar "Lower your weapon before someone gets hurt! We can talk about this!"

    #15. 
    player_narration "Although there were a few moments where Rimitar could have taken the offensive and turned Elyndir's aggression against him, he chose to continue defending instead, apparently hoping Elyndir would calm down."

    #16. 
    player_narration "But if that was his hope then it seemed to be in vain, as Elyndir's bloodlust showed no sign of abating as he continued to launch attack after attack."

    #17. 
    player_narration "I'd never realised that this was the reason Elyndir wanted to find his father: vengeance."

    #18. 
    player_narration "The fact that he'd hidden this from me, that he'd used me in this way, called into question everything I thought I knew about him and what kind of person he was."

    #19. 
    player_narration "Had I been deluded all along? Was Elyndir really nothing more than a lying, revenge-driven criminal? Or was his desire for vengeance understandable, if perhaps misguided?"

    player_narration "Seconds passed in tense silence as Elyndir and Rimitar continued to stare at each other. The tip of Elyndir's sword never wavered - a single thrust and Rimitar would be dead. "#(GO TO 21.30.)

    #21.30.

    #21.34.
    player_narration "Magical energy began to appear around Elyndir's hands, before gently flowing forth into Rimitar's blood-soaked torso. Elyndir was healing him. "#(GO TO 21.35.)

    #21.36.
    player_narration "Rimitar came around quickly, looking down at his own body, where the fresh wound should have been. Thanks to Elyndir's healing magic, however, the wound was gone. "#(GO TO 21.37.)

    #5. 
    player_narration "I hadn't told him where we were going, only that there was something I wanted him to see. I told him to wear a cloak and hood, and to keep the latter over his head."

    #6. 
    player_narration "I admit that for a moment it felt strange walking into the Sacred Grove with a Dahris at my side..."

    #7. 
    player_narration "...but I suppose that was to be expected given that this place - and the natural, life-affirming magic which was so strong here - had been such a bitter point of contention between the Lyris and the Dahris for so very long."

    #8. 
    player_narration "But I quickly reminded myself that it wasn't just a Dahris at my side, it was Elyndir, and that when it came to that ancient enmity between the Lyris and Dahris, he felt the same way as me: he didn't really care."

    #9. 
    player_narration "I'd wanted to leave home early so that we'd hopefully arrive at the grove at a time when there was likely to be no one around, and now I was relieved to see that was the case."

    #10. 
    player_narration "We paused at the edge of the grove, Elyndir's head moving as his eyes roamed over the birth trees. The grass and leaves rustled gently in the cool morning breeze as I watched him."

    #11. 
    elyndir "Is this... the Sacred Grove?"

    #12. 
    player "Yes."

    #13. 
    player_narration "Although he was good at playing his cards close to his chest, I was glad to see a smile appear on Elyndir's lips. I don't think he even knew he was doing it."

    #14. 
    player "What do you think?"

    #15. 
    elyndir "...It's beautiful."

    #16. 
    player_narration "I started walking deeper into the grove, Elyndir once again falling into step beside me. We moved at a relaxed pace, taking in and enjoying the atmosphere."

    #17. 
    player_narration "A hint of a smile remained on Elyndir's lips, and he looked more at peace than I'd ever seen him."

    #18. 
    player_narration "I wondered if him being half-Lyris and possessing the inherent healing magic that he did made him feel an instinctive connection to the Sacred Grove. With his Lyris heritage, I thought it a shame that Elyndir didn't have his own birth tree."

    #19. 
    player "These are all birth trees. When a Lyris is born, their family plants a birth tree for them as a symbol of life and growth."

    #20. 
    player "But the birth trees are more than that. Each tree becomes fundamentally connected to the Lyris whose birth it marks. So when that Lyris dies, so does their tree."

    #21. 
    elyndir "I'm assuming it doesn't work the other way around - that if I start chopping down these trees, Lyris are going to start dropping dead a hundred miles away."

    #22. 
    player "No, it doesn't work that way. Although losing a birth tree can still be a terrible blow to a Lyris."

    #23. 
    player_narration "After walking for a time, I came to a stop at the specific spot to which I'd been leading elyndir "my own birth tree. Elyndir looked at the tree and then at me.""

    #24. 
    player "This is my tree."

    #25. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I both admired my birth tree as I ran a hand over the bark of the trunk. The tree was healthy and growing well, its branches thick and filled with leaves and reaching towards the sky."

    #26. 
    player_narration "Growing out of the ground at the base of my tree were some wild flowers. They were in full bloom, their colour a mixture of brilliant shades of purple and blue."

    #27. 
    player_narration "I picked one of the flowers and brought it up to my nose, breathing in its sweet fragrance. I held the flower out to Elyndir. He accepted it and smiled at me."

    #28. 
    elyndir "Thank you."

    #29. 
    elyndir "...Hang on, this isn't some kind of Lyris marriage ceremony that you're tricking me into, is it?"

    #30. 
    player_narration "I laughed and gave Elyndir a playful smack on the shoulder as he grinned at me."

    #31. 
    player "You wish."

    #32. 
    player_narration "I sat before my birth tree, gestured towards the ground next to me and looked up at Elyndir."

    #33. 
    player "Sit down."

    #34. 
    player_narration "Elyndir looked around, checking to see if we were still the only people in sight. Once he was satisfied that we were, he sat next to me."

    #35. 
    player_narration "We didn't say anything for a while, both of us simply enjoying the tranquility of the Sacred Grove, comfortable in each other's company. Elyndir held onto his flower, studying it now and again."

    #36. 
    elyndir "It's hard to think that a place like this could inspire hatred and conflict like it does between the Dahris and Lyris. Seems to me like someone's missing the point."

    #37. 
    player "I know. Most people seem to just accept that the Dahris and Lyris are enemies and that's how it's always going to be, when at the end of the day we're all just people. It's nonsense. Hopefully things will change in time."

    #38. 
    elyndir "It would be nice to think so. I know it's something my mother's always wanted. I suppose that's why I grew up not hating the Lyris like so many other Dahris of my age did. She taught me it didn't matter."

    #39. 
    elyndir "Although my mother has actively worked to try to improve relations between the Dahris and Lyris over the years, and I've never gone that far."

    #40. 
    elyndir "I've always been more focused on looking out for myself. In my line of work that attitude helps keep you alive."

    #41. 
    elyndir "But being here now... I think I understand a little better why she does it, even if she's never seen this place. As far as I know, anyway."

    #42. 
    player "It's people like your mother who'll make a difference. As I said, things will change."

    #43. 
    elyndir "I suppose we'll see."

    #44. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I smiled at each other and then settled into another comfortable silence."

    #45. 
    player_narration "The sun continued to rise in the sky, scattered rays of its light filtering through the leaves of the trees and dappling the grove floor below."

    #46. 
    player_narration "As beautiful a sight as it was, it was also a reminder that time was passing, and that the longer Elyndir and I remained here, the greater the risk we were taking."

    #47. 
    player_narration "Reluctantly I suggested that it was best we head home, and Elyndir - just as reluctantly - agreed. He rose to his feet and offered me his hand, helping me up."

    #48. 
    player_narration "Rather than let go of his hand, I held onto it, and we left the Sacred Grove that way, connected to each other as well as to the beauty and magic "
