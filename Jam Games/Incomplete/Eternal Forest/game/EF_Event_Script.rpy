    #Location: Fort Sol-Nahr, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Fort Sol-Nahr in Lyriathis. The sun is shining. Player-Character (PC) stands in a courtyard facing his brother, Olin. Standing at the other end of the courtyard with some other soldiers is Commander Hael.

    #8. 
    player_narration "Olin and I stood there like that and spoke for a time, each of us talking about what we'd been up to recently, our parents and other things."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Eventually I noticed something catch Olin's eye and I followed his gaze to find myself looking at an armoured, serious-looking lyrian who was walking in our direction."

    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. It is daytime and the sun is shining. The square is full of people, some passing through or standing around while others are busy shopping or selling, the square bustling with activity. Player-Character (PC) is standing alone on the outskirts of the square.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The connecting streets had been busy enough, but when I stepped off one such street and onto Lyr-Taer's main square, I was confronted with a sea of faces and a blanket of noise..."
    #2. 
    player_narration "...the crowds ever-shifting as the majority of people walked this way or that way across the spacious, open square, some strolling leisurely while others hurried, some alone and others in pairs or small groups."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The majority were Lyris, although I glimpsed a few Granians and Kiartar scattered here and there."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Some people on the square weren't moving because they were busy selling their wares from the market stalls at which they stood, calling out goods and prices in an effort to gain the attention of potential customers."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Standing around the perimeter of the square were a number of buildings housing a variety of larger businesses, including a pleasant-looking inn named the Golden Meadow and a large general store named the Lyr-Taer Goods Emporium."

    aistar "Well, I'd be giving it to you, but yeah. You could start today. Right now, in fact!"
    #20. 
    player "But if your job's so great, why would you offer it to someone who just walked in off the street?"
    #21. 
    aistar "You can have too much of a good thing, my friend. Why not share the wealth, that's what I say. Honestly, I'm presenting you with quite the opportunity here, you'd be mad to pass it up."
    #22. 
    player_narration "I studied Aistar for a moment. He was doing his best, but his best was far too blatant and I hadn't been born yesterday, so I wasn't going to fall for it."
    #23. 
    player "I saw your face when I came in. You're bored out of your mind here and you want to dump your job onto me, is that it?"
    #24. 
    player_narration "Aistar leaned back again and did his best to look offended, but it was no more convincing than his previous efforts."
    #25. 
    aistar "What? No, no, of course not! Frankly, I'm offended by the accusation!"
    #26. 
    player_narration "As quickly as he'd leaned back, Aistar leaned in towards me again, even closer this time, and he looked around in a suspicious manner, as if he didn't want anyone overhearing. He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper."
    #27.

    player "How, exactly?"
    #33. 
    aistar "Look, maybe I shouldn't be telling you this but... I'm actually a secret agent of the Lyr-Taer city guard, my job here is just a cover while I carry out my vital law enforcement work."

    #9. 
    player_narration "Although I frowned in confusion at this odd and silent welcome, I took the offered sword. The lyrian took a couple of steps back and held his sword out before him in one hand, prepared to use it."

    player_narration "Now it was obvious what he expected of me, so I decided to play along. Mirroring him, I stepped backwards myself and raised my own sword."

    player_narration "I looked up and opened my mouth to say something to Rimitar, but found that he was already walking away from me and over to an open doorway at one side of the room."

    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. It is daytime and the sun is shining. The square is full of people, some passing through or standing around while others are busy shopping or selling, the square bustling with activity. Player-Character (PC) is standing alone on the outskirts of the square.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The connecting streets had been busy enough, but when I stepped off one such street and onto Lyr-Taer's main square, I was confronted with a sea of faces and a blanket of noise..."

    #3. 
    player_narration "Some people on the square weren't moving because they were busy selling their wares from the market stalls at which they stood, calling out goods and prices in an effort to gain the attention of potential customers."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Standing around the perimeter of the square were a number of buildings housing a variety of larger businesses, including the Golden Meadow and a large general store named the Lyr-Taer Goods Emporium."

    player_narration "Although it was partially obscured from my view by several buildings due to the spot in which I was standing, I could see some of the High Lord's Palace just beyond the square..."

    player_narration "...and even this glimpse was enough to get an idea of the vast size of the building and the grandness of both its design and that of the surrounding property."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I walked across the square in the direction of the palace, thinking of perhaps approaching the main entrance to see the property up-close."
    #8. 
    player_narration "But when the main entrance – a pair of large, sturdy-looking metal gates – came into view, I saw a pair of large, sturdy-looking guards standing before it, their expressions serious, their armour polished and their weapons sharp."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I thought better of approaching the gate and instead came to a stop on the square, my eyes roaming over the impressive home of High Lord Tialas as life in the bustling centre of the sprawling capital city flowed around me. "

    #Location: Ashel's home, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the home of Councillor of Finance Ashel, specifically a study. The study, like the rest of the house, is large, grand and expensively decorated, a sign of Ashel's status as a noble. It is during the day, the room illuminated by the sunlight streaming in through several tall windows. Sitting behind a large desk is Ashel, while sitting in a chair on the opposite side of the desk is Player-Character (PC), the two of them facing each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "After receiving an invitation from Councillor of Finance Ashel, I arrived at his home at the date and time he'd specified."
    #2. 
    player_narration "A young servant greeted me at the door and showed me into the large, grand house. The two of us walking in silence, she led me to a study in which Ashel was sitting behind a large desk."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Ashel nodded at the servant, who still said nothing as she then left the room, closing the doors behind her and leaving Ashel and I alone in the study. I approached the councillor's desk."
    #4. 
    ashel "Hello, [PLAYER NAME]. Take a seat."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I sat in a chair on the opposite side of the desk to Ashel, the two of us facing each other, his expression businesslike and humourless."
    #6. 
    player "Thank you, councillor. I assume you wanted to speak to me about our journey to Belgran?"
    #7. 
    ashel "That's correct. As you're already aware, this is a very important task, one which could prove vital in how events play out regarding this alliance between the Dahris and Kiartar."
    #8. 
    ashel "And so I wanted to ensure you're also aware of some important details pertaining to our journey. I will have my mind on numerous concerns while we are in Grana, I don't intend for the potential ignorance of my companions to be one of them."
    #9. 
    player "Of course. If I may ask, who else will be travelling with us?"
    #10. 
    ashel "A few of my most trusted advisors and colleagues who will assist me in my dealings with Eadgar, and an escort of city guards to protect us during our travels and our time in Belgran."
    #11. 
    ashel "Now, the Granians. I've had dealings with King Eadgar in the past – he is a proud man, but not unreasonable. He is certainly not the worst Granian king I've met."
    #12. 
    ashel "He has a wife, Queen Leogytha, and a young son, Prince Cenric. I don't know if you will encounter either of them during our time there, but should you do so then you will of course extend the proper courtesies, as you will do so at all other relevant times."
    #13. 
    ashel "Eadgar is assisted by a group of three advisors, a system similar to our own High Council, and of course other royals and nobles will no doubt want to inform the king of their own opinions regarding our visit and the Dahris-Kiartar alliance."
    #14. 
    ashel "Granians can be just as pragmatic as anyone else when necessary, so I'm hopeful that Eadgar will indeed see the threat that the alliance represents, and that he will join us in taking steps to deal with it."
    #15. 
    player "Or the king could decide that siding with the Dahris and Kiartar is the better option."
    #16. 
    player_narration "For a moment I wondered if I'd spoken out of turn, but then a small, cynical smile appeared briefly on Ashel's face."
    #17. 
    ashel "He may indeed. My responsibility is to see that he doesn't."
    #18. 
    ashel "As for your own part in assisting me, simply behave in the proper manner, pay attention, and do as I say. This is what I expect of you. If you don't believe yourself fit for the task, now is the time to say so."
    #19. 
    player "I'm ready, sir."
    #20. 
    ashel "Good. Our date of departure is [INSERT DATE HERE]. You will arrive here at my home at seven o'clock in the morning. If you're late, we'll leave without you. And in that event, your failure would of course be noted."
    #21. 
    player "I understand."
    #22. 
    ashel "You're expected to bring your own supplies and money, this isn't a holiday. In case you weren't unaware, the Granians use the same currency as us."
    #23. 
    ashel "I do suggest you bring some warm clothing, however – the weather in Grana can be cold in comparison to our own."
    #24. 
    player "Alright. Thank you, councillor."
    #25. 
    ashel "You may leave now. My servant will show you the way out."
    #26.

    #Location: King Eadgar's Castle, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically the main hall. It is night, the hall illuminated by numerous torches and candles. Long tables covered in food and drink line the room, and sitting at the tables are dozens of people, mostly Granians, although there are Lyris and Dahris present as well, the occasion being King Eadgar's official welcome to Councillor of Finance Ashel and his party. Player-Character (PC) sits next to Ashel.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Although night had fallen on Belgran, the main hall of King Eadgar's castle was brightly lit by numerous torches and candles as we sat down for the feast which acted as the official welcome for Councillor of Finance Ashel and his party."
    #2. 
    player_narration "During our journey, Ashel had told me that feasts were a common occurrence amongst the Granian upper classes, many of whom looked down upon those who didn't share their passion such food- and drink-fuelled gatherings."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Sure enough, the long wooden tables at which we sat were covered in numerous types of food and drink, and a number of servants came and went, helping to provide for the several dozen guests, including myself."
    #4. 
    player_narration "In the time I'd spent so far at the castle – a vast and solidly built fortress which, despite its furnishings, always seemed cold and brooding to me – I'd seen a lot of servants..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...some little more than children while others were old and worn-down, although all went about their work dutifully."
    #6. 
    player_narration "King Eadgar sat on an ornate chair at the head of the main table, a tankard of ale in one hand and his crown on his head, his face hard and weathered."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The people who filled the hall were mostly Granians, highborn men and women, while I, Ashel and the rest of our travelling companions – minus the guards – made up the Lyris contingent."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Something which had surprised me – and Ashel, who'd been in a grim mood ever since – was a fact we learned soon after arriving at the castle: the king was currently acting as host not just to us, but also to a party of Dahris."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Apparently the Dahris ambassador, Hellaren, and her party had arrived just a few days before us, and although Ashel had been making subtle but determined attempts to learn the exact reason why they were here..."
    #10. 
    player_narration "...so far the king and anyone else involved had waved it away as a simple diplomatic matter of little importance. But I knew Ashel wasn't convinced. And frankly, neither was I."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Ashel's mood certainly wasn't helped by the fact that he'd yet to be granted a full, formal meeting with Eadgar regarding the Dahris-Kiartar alliance, the very reason why we'd come to Belgran in the first place."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I'd been seated next to Ashel, and now I looked at the councillor as he rose to his feet, holding his glass of wine before his chest, and looked towards King Eadgar. The chatter at the tables died away."
    #13. 
    ashel "King Eadgar, on behalf of myself, High Lord Tialas and the rest of the Lyris people, I wish to extend our thanks to you for the warm welcome you have shown my colleagues and I."
    #14. 
    ashel "While some Lyris may never venture into Grana to experience what your fine nation has to offer..."
    #15. 
    ashel "...as an ambassador to my people it pleases me to know that those who do can always expect to find the Granian hand of friendship extended to them."
    #16. 
    ashel "And of course you and your people will always find the same hand awaiting you in Lyriathis."
    #17. 
    ashel "The relationship between our two lands has been one of trust and peace for countless generations... and long may it continue."
    #18. 
    player_narration "Ashel raised his glass in a toast to Eadgar. The king stood up as Ashel sat back down."
    #19. 
    eadgar "Fine words, councillor. Fine and true."
    #20. 
    eadgar "I've often been accused of being a man of few words, so it should come as no surprise I have little to add to what you said."
    #21. 
    eadgar "Peace and trust between all nations is of the utmost importance, perhaps now more than ever."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Eadgar glanced in the direction of the Dahris ambassador, something which I noticed and which I was sure Ashel must have done as well. Although it no doubt bothered him, the councillor didn't show it."
    #23. 
    eadgar "Long may it continue indeed."
    #24. 
    player_narration "King Eadgar raised his tankard in a toast and all of the guests followed suit. When Eadgar sat down again, the talk around the tables resumed, people eating and drinking at the same time."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Despite his fine words and the fact that he hid it as best he could, Ashel remained in a tense mood, the presence of the Dahris and his lack of information on their motives gnawing at him."
    #26. 
    player_narration "After a time he spoke to me in a slightly hushed voice, quiet enough so as not to be overheard by the people sitting around us, while occasionally glancing in my direction."
    #27. 
    ashel "Alright, [PLAYER NAME], pay attention. It is time for you to learn some things."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I leaned in slightly towards Ashel and followed his gaze to the top of our table, where King Eadgar sat with his wife, Queen Leogytha, their son, Prince Cenric, and Eadgar's three advisors."
    #29. 
    ashel "You needn't give much thought to the queen and prince. As far as I am aware, she has little impact on Eadgar's rule and the decisions he makes. Whether this is a situation to her liking is of course a different matter."
    #30. 
    ashel "As for the prince, he is but a child. Even if his father were to suddenly pass away and Cenric be seated on the throne, a boy-king holds no true power but is merely a crowned puppet whose strings are pulled by those around him."
    #31. 
    ashel "Now, Eadgar's advisors. Do you see the man in the hat there, seated next to the queen?"
    #32. 
    player_narration "Ashel was looking in the direction of a portly, middle-aged man dressed in expensive clothes. He was gnawing hungrily at a chicken leg while making occasional comments to a seemingly uninterested Leogytha."
    #33. 
    ashel "That is Dain, Treasurer of the Realm. The man in charge of Grana's finances. He is corrupt and greedy, but not so much that he ever jeopardises his position, which he has held for some years. He is more cunning than he looks."
    #34. 
    ashel "Although Eadgar is wise enough to not fully trust Dain, ultimately the treasurer does his job well enough that the king heeds his council."
    #35. 
    ashel "But while there may be no friendship between Eadgar and Dain, there is downright enmity between the treasurer and the man at his side."
    #36. 
    player_narration "The man sitting next to Dain was young and handsome, with black hair and – rather more noticeably – black eyes. He wore a robe, and a staff leaned against the back of his chair."
    #37. 
    player_narration "His smile was easy and confident as he spoke to a couple of people around him, although he and the treasurer ignored each other completely."
    #38. 
    ashel "You are looking at Grana's equivalent of an archmage: the Master of Sorceries. That man, Arden, is the position's current occupier."
    #39. 
    player "Am I mistaken, or are his eyes black?"
    #40. 
    ashel "They are. A side-effect from a spell he attempted when he was younger, or so he claims. He won't say what that particular spell was, however."
    #41. 
    player "He looks young for a man in his position."
    #42. 
    player_narration "Ashel didn't comment on that one way or the other. I looked away, not wanting to be caught staring at the Master of Sorceries, and that was when my eyes happened to meet those of the Dahris ambassador."
    #43. 
    player_narration "Hellaren was sitting amongst the several of her travelling companions who had accompanied her to the feast, all of them very measured and calm in their movements, with only a little discussion passing between them here and there."
    #44. 
    player_narration "She was beautiful, that was undeniable, and a few Granians around the table had been giving her occasional but lingering looks. I didn't look away as she held my gaze. A smile flitted across her lips. "
    #45. 
    player_narration "I acknowledged the smile with a polite one of my own along with a slight nod of my head."
    #46. 
    player_narration "I suddenly realised that Ashel was still talking, but I hadn't been listening. I looked away from Hellaren and back towards the councillor before interrupting him."
    #47. 
    player "I'm sorry, councillor, what was that?"
    #48. 
    player_narration "Ashel stopped talking and looked at me with a disapproving frown, although I was confident he hadn't noticed who exactly had distracted me – that little detail certainly wouldn't have helped matters."
    #49. 
    ashel "I said magic isn't a fundamental aspect of Granian society as it is ours, most Granians are suspicious of it and would sooner place their faith in physical tools and weapons, thing they can actually hold in their hands."
    #50. 
    ashel "Not that mages and the study of magic are totally absent or without influence in Grana, of course, as you can see by Arden's close proximity to the king."
    #51. 
    ashel "Although even after many generations the Master of Sorceries traditionally remains the least influential of the king's three advisors – as it was with his predecessors, so it is with Eadgar."
    #52. 
    ashel "But to Eadgar's credit, although he is no practitioner of or great believer in magic, as a leader he recognises it as a force he cannot afford to ignore, so he is not deaf to Arden's voice."
    #53. 
    ashel "As for Arden himself, his self-centred nature has hardly enamoured him or magic in general to his people."
    #54. 
    ashel "Now for the last of the three advisors..."
    #55. 
    player_narration "I followed Ashel's gaze to find him looking at a tall, lean man with long, tied-back hair. His expression was stern and guarded."
    #56. 
    ashel "heimar "Lord Marshal of the Granian military and old friend to King Eadgar. He is a celebrated soldier, a veteran of numerous military campaigns and skirmishes.""
    #57. 
    ashel "He and Eadgar have known each other since they were children, and I think it is safe to say that the king trusts him above anyone else, including his own wife. As for Heimar, his loyalty to his friend and king seems to have never wavered."
    #58. 
    ashel "Of Eadgar's three advisors, he is the one with the most influence over the king and the kingdom's affairs. So if Eadgar does not see the threat represented by the Dahris-Kiartar alliance and we cannot open his eyes to it..."
    #59. 
    ashel "...then our best option will be to speak to Heimar and hope we have more success there. As a lifelong military man, perhaps he will be more receptive to the threat that the alliance poses."
    #60. 
    player_narration "I merely nodded as I knew Ashel wasn't really looking for my opinion on this, he was simply concerned about our mission and what the presence of the Dahris party might mean for the entire endeavour."
    #61. 
    player_narration "In fact, I noticed that the councillor was now looking in the direction of the Dahris ambassador, although she happened to be looking elsewhere. Ashel's brow creased in a frown."
    #62. 
    ashel "Hopefully the Granians will understand that danger preceded by smiles and sweet words is no less a danger because of them. "

    #Location: King Eadgar's Castle, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically a study which is currently serving as the Lyris embassy while Councillor of Finance Ashel and his companions are in Belgran. The room contains some bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a couch, a desk and two chairs. Daylight enters through a couple of windows, and there is one wooden door, currently closed. Ashel is standing before one of the windows, looking out through it, while Player-Character (PC) stands a few feet inside the room, the door behind him.
    #1. 
    player_narration "After receiving a summons from Ashel, I navigated some of the cold, stone halls of King Eadgar's castle until I eventually arrived at the study which was serving as Ashel's office during our stay."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Ashel stood before one of the windows, his hands clasped together behind his back as he stared through the glass at the bleak, grey day outside."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Our diplomatic mission to Belgran was dragging on, and Ashel, even with how reserved and businesslike he was by nature, had been gradually losing his patience with the whole affair."
    #4. 
    player_narration "He'd managed to arrange a meeting with Eadgar, and although I didn't attend it myself, from what he'd mentioned of it to me since, it seems to have been brief, uninformative and inconclusive."
    #5. 
    player_narration "As far as I knew, Eadgar had made no definitive statements on the Dahris-Kiartar alliance, and had continued to dodge Ashel's enquiries regarding the ongoing presence of the Dahris ambassador, Hellaren, and her party."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Frustrated by the king, Ashel had arranged discreet meetings with some other Granian nobles and people of influence, but as with Eadgar, I hadn't been present to witness them."
    #7. 
    player_narration "In fact, my time so far in Belgran had been largely uneventful, my presence hardly seeming needed, the tasks assigned to me by Ashel being simple and mundane ones."
    #8. 
    player_narration "As I closed the door behind me, Ashel turned around to face me, although he remained standing before the window. His expression was grim – still no improvement in our situation, then."
    #9. 
    player "You wanted to see me, councillor."
    #10. 
    ashel "As you know, our objective in coming here was to discuss the Dahris-Kiartar alliance with King Eadgar and, if necessary, convince him of the danger it represents. But this has proven difficult due to Eadgar's evasiveness. "
    #11. 
    ashel "I have recently been speaking with a number of Grana's key figures. When it comes to the subject of the alliance, the feelings of these Granians are mixed, as are their respective levels of usefulness to our cause."
    #12. 
    ashel "The fact is, I'm still trying to meet with the one man who has more influence with the king than all of them combined."
    #13. 
    player "Lord Marshal Heimar. I remember what you said at the feast."
    #14. 
    ashel "Yes. But my efforts to speak privately with him have proven disappointingly fruitless. More so than with Eadgar, in fact."
    #15. 
    ashel "At least I have been able to see the king, as brief and frustrating as those occasions have been. Heimar, however, has been impossible to pin down."
    #16. 
    ashel "But I don't believe he is avoiding me specifically. Word around the castle is he has been keeping odd hours recently, his visits to the castle being rarer and more covert than usual."
    #17. 
    ashel "Something is going on. And if there is even a chance that it is linked to the Dahris-Kiartar alliance or that party of Dahris the king is hosting, I want to know about it."
    #18. 
    ashel "I'm doing everything possible when it comes to Grana's rich and powerful, but it occurred to me that perhaps any secrets surrounding them may have filtered down to those of lower social standing: the common folk."
    #19. 
    ashel "That is where you come in, [PLAYER NAME]. While my colleagues and I are occupied with our own plans, I want you to roam the castle and the city outside and try to learn any useful information."
    #20. 
    ashel "You're young and good at communicating with people, you may stand out as a Lyris but I'm sure plenty of Granians will be happy enough to speak with you."
    #21. 
    ashel "Even if it's wild and baseless rumours, I don't care – anything you hear regarding Heimar, Eadgar, the Dahris-Kiartar alliance, or Hellaren and her party, I want to hear it as well. Do you understand?"
    #22. 
    player_narration "It seemed my stay in Belgran was about to become more eventful after all. While part of me thought that Ashel had become desperate enough that he was clutching at straws, I was smart enough not to voice the thought."
    #23. 
    player "Yes. I'll get stated today."
    #24. 
    ashel "Good. But remember to be subtle about it. Report to me when you have anything."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Ashel turned back to the window, our discussion apparently over. Charged with my new mission, I left the room. "

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and talking as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) is sitting on a stool at the counter.
    #1. 
    player_narration "In an attempt to complete the mission Ashel had tasked me with, I'd recently started spending most of my evenings in the tavern named the Moon and Sabre, a popular Belgran drinking establishment."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I was trying to spend time somewhere I could overhear and draw out as much of the local gossip as possible without appearing too conspicuous, and a tavern seemed like the perfect place. Booze tended to loosen people's lips, after all."
    #3. 
    player_narration "After several days of thirst-quenching research across several taverns, I settled upon the Moon and Sabre as my focal point: it was always fairly busy, with a casual and cheerful – but not overly rowdy – air."
    #4. 
    player_narration "The tavern was owned by Meda, a woman who was often smiling and from a distance seemed pleasant enough, but who actually took a little too much pride in herself and her business."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I'd often overheard her criticising not only Belgran's other taverns and inns but also the people who owned them, Meda clearly considering herself and her own tavern far superior to the competitors she looked down upon."
    #6. 
    player_narration "While she wasn't someone I could ever see myself trusting or admiring, I did think that she might prove useful in my mission. Booze wasn't the only thing that could loosen lips, after all – so could pride."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I entered the Moon and Sabre on another chilly evening, although Meda always managed to keep the tavern's interior at a decent temperature."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Due to my Lyris nature I received curious glances from some of the other customers, but no more than that. The more regular locals had already seen me during my previous visits, and the novelty had worn off."
    #9. 
    player_narration "There was one vacant stool at the counter, and I sat on it before anyone else could claim it."
    #10. 
    player_narration "I looked along the counter at Meda, who was taking money from a man paying for his drinks. After a moment she noticed me and smiled in acknowledgement. She didn't seem to have any regular Lyris customers besides me."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Meda walked over to me as I placed some money on the counter."
    #12. 
    meda "Back again, then? Can't get enough, can you. Careful, you'll end up moving to Belgran just to drink in my tavern."
    #13. 
    player "I can think of worse fates. Tankard of ale, please."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Meda seemed pleased at my compliment as she picked up my money and poured my drink. That was good – I hadn't spoken to her a great deal during my previous visits as I didn't want to seem too obvious..."
    #15. 
    player_narration "...but this evening I intended to try to gather some information, and I was hopeful that keeping Meda sweet would help with that."
    #16. 
    player_narration "She returned with my ale and placed it before me. I gave her a smile."
    #17. 
    player "Thank you. Seems I'm not the only customer you're keeping happy – the place has been busy every time I've been in here."
    #18. 
    meda "That's because these folks know the Moon and Sabre is the best tavern in Belgran, that's why."
    #19. 
    player "I suppose I can count myself among them now, then. I've been in a few of the other taverns in the city but I wasn't too keen on most of them. I really do like your place, though."
    #20. 
    meda "Then congratulations, Lyris: you've got taste."
    #21. 
    player "I expect you get some of Grana's rich and powerful in here, noblemen and the like."
    #22. 
    meda "I can count some of the kingdom's finest amongst my clientele, yes."
    #23. 
    player "I don't suppose King Eadgar's drank in here, has he?"
    #24. 
    meda "Well, not the king himself, no, but plenty of other nobles and people of power have sampled my ale."
    #25. 
    player "I might've heard it wrong, but I'm sure I heard someone mention that Lord Marshal Heimar was in here recently. Is that true?"
    #26. 
    meda "Not recently, although he was in here with a couple of his men a few months back. They didn't stay long, I think they had to rush off, important business probably."
    #27. 
    meda "Anyway, he's got other things on his mind at the moment."
    #28. 
    player_narration "And there it was. I did my best to keep my voice casual when I next spoke."
    #29. 
    player "Really? Like what?"
    #30. 
    player_narration "Meda looked around in a conspiratorial manner before leaning on the counter, moving closer to me. She lowered her voice slightly."
    #31. 
    meda "Well, Heimar has a son, an eleven-year-old named Annegard. The boy went missing not long ago, just after the last hastilude King Eadgar held."
    #32. 
    meda "Heimar's been scouring the city ever since, but there's been no sign of Annegard. There have been a lot of outsiders around recently, during the hastilude and afterwards, some people think maybe one of them had something to do with it."
    #33. 
    meda "No offence, of course."
    #34. 
    player "None taken."
    #35. 
    meda "Anyway, you ask me, I think he probably just ran away from home. You know what children can be like."
    #36. 
    player_narration "I nodded and murmured agreement. A man approached the counter a few feet away from me and gestured to Meda for service. She leaned back and excused herself before going to take the man's order."
    #37. 
    player_narration "I didn't mind losing her attention, she'd already told me more than enough for me to report to Ashel."
    #38. 
    player_narration "It didn't take me long to finish my drink. Afterwards, I said goodbye to Meda before leaving the Moon and Sabre and heading for King Eadgar's castle. (GO TO PART C)"





    PART B

    #Location: King Eadgar's castle, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically a study which is currently serving as the Lyris embassy while Councillor of Finance Ashel and his companions are in Belgran. The room contains some bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a couch, a desk and two chairs. Daylight enters through a couple of windows, and there is one wooden door. Kivrin the servant girl is dusting the bookshelves as Player-Character (PC) enters the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I was walking along the hallway outside the study currently serving as Ashel's office when I noticed the door was slightly ajar. I stopped near it and listened, and could hear some kind of shuffling sound coming from within."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Since I knew Ashel always kept the door closed when he was in the study, I opened the door wider and stepped into the room, wondering who was inside."
    #3. 
    player_narration "It was one of King Eadgar's servants, and as the door creaked open, the young woman turned to look at me from where she stood before one of the sets of bookshelves."
    #4. 
    player_narration "She held a dusting cloth in one hand and looked at me with a shy, polite smile."
    #5. 
    kivrin "Sorry for the intrusion, but we're to keep the study clean for you during your stay. I saw it was empty, so I thought I'd do it while the room wasn't in use. I'll come back later."
    #6. 
    player_narration "She began to walk towards me, heading for the exit, but I casually gestured for her to stay while closing the door behind me."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I hadn't forgotten the mission Ashel had tasked me with, and this seemed like an ideal opportunity to speak to a castle servant in private."
    #8.

    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically a study which is currently serving as the Lyris embassy while Councillor of Finance Ashel and his companions are in Belgran. The room contains some bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a couch, a desk, two chairs, and one wooden door. It is night, the room illuminated by several candles.

    ashel "This does clarify Heimar's situation, although sadly not to our advantage."
    #5. 
    ashel "If we could find the boy and return him to his father, for example, then Heimar would be in our debt, which would obviously be hugely helpful in my dealings with Eadgar."
    #6. 
    ashel "But a search would be pointless – Heimar knows Belgran far better than any of us, and he must already be doing everything possible to find his son."
    #7. 
    ashel "And as long as Annegard remains missing, Heimar will no doubt be too distracted to want to listen to me."

Player-Character (PC) is standing next to the desk, and is the only person in the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I'd happened to be in the makeshift Lyrian embassy, scanning the bookshelves for something to read, when there was a knock on the door."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I called out for the person to enter, and a servant girl came into the room and handed me a letter, stating that she'd looked for me in my room and hadn't found me there, so had thought to try the study."
    #3. 
    player_narration "As for the letter, all she knew of it was that it was addressed to me and had been dropped off earlier at one of the castle gates. I thanked the servant and she left the room, closing the door behind her."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I stood next to the desk with the letter in my hands, my curiosity piqued. The envelope was plain, with nothing but my name written on it."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I opened the envelope and withdrew the single sheet of paper from within. There wasn't much written on the page, but what text there was made my blood run cold and my stomach churn:"
    #6. 
    player_narration ""Leave 1000 gold in a bag in the alley behind the Moon and Sabre at midnight tomorrow, or the king and lord marshal learn the truth about your plan to frame the Dahris. Come alone. You will be watched.""
    #7. 
    player_narration "A blackmail note. I read the text once more, my breathing loud in my ears, my heart pounding, and then hurriedly stuffed the paper into one of my pockets."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I placed the palms of both hands on the desk and leaned on it, my head bowed slightly as I shook it, not wanting to acknowledge the truth. I didn't understand – I'd been careful, who could've uncovered what I'd done?"
    #9. 
    player_narration "...Unless the blackmailer wasn't someone who'd learned the truth, but had been part of it: the two men I'd paid to be witnesses."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Both had seemed content enough with the payment they'd received, but these were men more than willing to lie to their king and lord marshal, them being greedy didn't seem that farfetched."
    #11. 
    player_narration "But again, I'd always been careful in my dealings with them, disguising my face and even my Lyris nature, never revealing my name, my business in Belgran, or where I was living in the city."
    #12. 
    player_narration "If the blackmailer was one or both of the witnesses, perhaps they followed me after one of our meetings and learned about me from there."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Or perhaps they were indirectly responsible, letting slip the details of our arrangement to someone who had then uncovered my identity and seen an opportunity to earn some money from the situation."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Whatever the cause, a couple of things were certain: I needed to deal with this quickly and quietly, and Ashel couldn't find out about it."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Although I'd been as careful as possible, ultimately all of this had been my plan, so the responsibility fell on my shoulders."
    #16. 
    player_narration "There was too much at stake, not just for me but for our entire country. I couldn't let the mission fall apart, not now."
    #17. 
    player_narration "I stood up straight again and took a deep breath, steeling myself. After confirming that the blackmail note was still in my pocket, I left the room, thinking about my next move. "

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and talking as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) is sitting at a corner table with Ashel and a cloaked figure who is one of Ashel's informants in Belgran.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was a cold evening as Ashel and I sat at a corner table in the Moon and Sabre, a spot far enough away from the tavern's other customers that we were afforded some privacy."
    #2. 
    player_narration "And privacy was vital to our reason for being here at this time, as we weren't alone – sitting with us was a Belgran citizen who had for some time been acting as one of Ashel's informants."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The man's face was shrouded in shadow as he sat in a thick cloak and hood, just one of several Granians who Ashel secretly paid to keep him informed of any noteworthy developments in the capital city."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Earlier today, this informant – neither he nor Ashel were inclined to tell me his name – sent word to Ashel that he'd learnt something which the councillor would want to know about right away."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Ashel set the time and place for their meeting, and told me I'd be accompanying him. When I asked why we didn't meet his informant at King Eadgar's castle, Ashel stated that the castle's walls had ears."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Now, speaking in a hushed voice, Ashel's informant revealed what he'd learnt, and the revelation turned out to be a troubling one."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The informant claimed that one of the things which lay at the heart of the Dahris-Kiartar alliance was a plan for the two nations to collaborate on the creation of new types of weaponry."
    #8. 
    player_narration "The Kiartar had always been renowned for their skill with metals, the creation of fine weapons being a part of this tradition."
    #9. 
    player_narration "With the Kiartar counting few magic-users amongst their people, however, they never dabbled with the creation of any kind of magical weapons, preferring simple, solid metals with no magical enhancements."
    #10. 
    player_narration "This lack of interest in magic made Kiartar weaponry popular with Granians but of less interest to many Lyris and Dahris, two peoples more inclined towards sorcery."
    #11. 
    player_narration "But something was about to change, claimed Ashel's informant: Dahraith was sending its most powerful mages to Kron-Gantir to combine their knowledge of magic with the Kiartar's knowledge of weaponry."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Together, the two nations intended to develop a number of new weapons of great power, ones which combined magic and metal to deadly effect, harnessing the strengths of both."
    #13. 
    player_narration "As for the Dahris' intentions regarding Grana, they were seeking to create a trade agreement between Dahraith, Kron-Gantir and Grana..."
    #14. 
    player_narration "...one which would allow the Dahris and Kiartar to move goods through Granian territory, goods which would include these new magical weapons as they were transported from Kron-Gantir to Dahraith and vice-versa."
    #15. 
    player_narration "However, the Dahris and Kiartar had no intention of informing the Granians of the existence of these new weapons, which would essentially be smuggled across Grana while disguised as everyday shipments."
    #16. 
    player_narration "It seemed the Dahris and Kiartar didn't want to share their new weapons with the Granians, they just wanted official access to Granian land, offering far less than what they would actually gain in return."
    #17. 
    player_narration "The trade negotiations were currently ongoing and had been for some time, partly due to the delays and discord created by Ashel and myself. It wasn't much, but you take your victories where you can."
    #18. 
    player_narration "As far as the informant knew, King Eadgar and his advisors remained ignorant of the true intentions of the Dahris and Kiartar."
    #19. 
    player_narration "When the informant finished speaking, Ashel's expression was grave, as I imagine was my own. We were both well aware that if true, this weapon development news could spell real trouble in the future."
    #20. 
    player_narration "Ashel stealthily withdrew an unmarked envelope from one pocket and slipped it to his informant beneath the table. Saying nothing, the man stood up, walked away from our table and left the tavern."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Ashel sipped his ale with a troubled frown on his face. Then he set down his tankard and looked at me as he spoke in a quiet voice."
    #22. 
    ashel "Your thoughts, [PLAYER NAME]?"
    #23. 
    player "Since the Kiartar have thrown in with the Dahris, it's more important than ever that we solidify the Granians' status as our ally. The fact that Eadgar is being lied to about these weapons should help us do that."
    #24. 
    player "Otherwise, if the worst came to the worst, Lyriathis could end up alone and fighting a war against three hostile races."
    #25. 
    ashel "That is a possibility. But we can't approach Eadgar directly with this information, we have no proof – he'd have no reason to believe that we weren't simply slandering the Dahris."
    #26. 
    ashel "Better that we hinder the Dahris' plans secretly until we can bring definitive proof to light. We'd also need to convince Eadgar that the Dahris and Kiartar planned to use their new weapons against Grana at some point..."
    #27. 
    ashel "...otherwise the king might well be tempted to strike some sort of deal with them in order for Grana to gain access to the weapons. We cannot allow that to happen."

It is daytime, the room illuminated by sunlight entering through the windows.

    dain "What's this?"
    #9.

    #16. 
    player_narration "The servants set the dishes on the table, between myself and Dain, and then just as promptly and silently left the room again. My eyes roamed over the dishes, as did Dain's."
    #17. 
    dain "Well, tuck in."
    #18. 
    player_narration "Dain and I ate and drank, and made small talk. I was careful not to broach any important subjects just yet – I was confident that the more wine and food the treasurer consumed, the more pliable he would be in our discussions."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Eventually each of us sat back, both having eaten our fill, Dain's capacity for food being larger than my own. The treasurer topped up our glasses with wine and sighed contentedly."
    #20. 
    dain "Ah, that hit the spot. I hope the food was to your liking?"
    #21. 
    player "It was excellent, thank you. I think there's much that each of our countries has to offer the other, and not just in terms of cuisine."
    #22. 
    player "General trade, for example. Now, trade between Lyriathis and Grana has been steady and profitable enough for both sides for many years, of course..."
    #23.

    #28.

    #34. 
    player "In fact, I heard that the Kiartar aren't agreeing to any new weaponry orders requested by Grana, that their weapons industry is now wholly focused on selling to the Dahris instead."

    #10. 
    player "A gift: some Lyris books on a variety of sorcery-related matters. I thought you might enjoy them."

    #12. 
    player_narration "...and I was surprised to see an expression of disappointment creep onto his face, replacing his eager curiosity. I was surprised because I knew the books to be fairly rare and valuable items."

    player_narration "Arden was polite enough to put on a grateful smile as he pushed the small pile of books to one side."
    #14. 
    arden "Thank you. I look forward to studying them."

    player "Councillor Ashel wished me to pass on his admiration for your dedication to sorcery, especially when so many of your fellow Granians feel so differently about it."
    #16. 
    arden "Yes, this country's fear and ignorance of magic go back a long time, and it remains an unfortunately widespread issue even in these modern times. So many ignorant minds turning their backs on a world of possibilities."
    #17. 
    arden "But not me. My eyes are open, my mind eager for knowledge. I see the possibilities... and I wish to reach out and take hold of them."
    #18. 
    arden "And perhaps this is something with which you could help me, my Lyris friend. Your people embrace magic, I envy that. Being surrounded by blinkered minds as I am is hardly conducive to my own work."

    arden "I would dearly love to learn more about the many wonders of Lyriathis, and perhaps experience them for myself someday."
    #20.

    #21. 
    arden "In fact, that brings me to one thing in particular which you might be able to clarify for me..."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Arden smiled at me with a keen glint in his eyes."
    #23. 
    arden "I've heard it said that somewhere in Lyriathis is a magical spring, the waters of which are the source of not only your magic but also the astounding longevity which your people enjoy. Is this true?"

    player "Not as far as I know."
    #25.

    player_narration "Arden had come up with the law and proposed it to King Eadgar, who, given his own reservations in regard to sorcery – reservations still shared by many other Granians – had been happy enough to put it into force immediately."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Arden's sudden desire to see such a law had come after he was attacked by an unseen assailant – that would be me – while walking home one evening, his attacker striking him with a magical spell before running off into the night."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Despite his own magical abilities and previously stated desire to see magic used more often in Grana, Arden seemed to have been unnerved by the assault..."
    #9. 
    player_narration "...even though I'd been careful to use a spell which did barely any physical damage, Arden having merely been blasted off his feet and into a stack of crates. Apparently that had been enough to rattle him, however."
    #10. 
    player_narration "The passing of this new law had been an unexpected overreaction which Ashel was far from pleased with."
    #11. 
    player_narration "As well as whatever hindrance it might represent to our mission in Belgran, I think Ashel considered it humiliating to have to ask for permission in this way..."
    #12. 
    player_narration "...especially when the actual magical skill possessed by Grana's "Master of Sorceries"was far below that of the most talented Lyris mages."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Even so, it was a necessary evil if we were to continue our work in Belgran, and so Ashel forced a polite smile as we came to a stop before Arden's desk."
    #14. 
    ashel "Good morning, Master Arden. I believe you're expecting us."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Arden looked us over, a polite smile appearing briefly on his own lips before his expression became businesslike."
    #16. 
    arden "Yes, I have your permits here."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Arden opened one of the desk's drawers and withdrew several small pieces of paper, each one with some text written on it. He handed them out to Ashel, who took them."
    #18. 
    arden "There are permits there for each of you as well as the other Lyris in your party. Be sure to carry them at all times. No exceptions – it's the law."
    #19. 
    ashel "Of course. If you don't mind my asking, have you managed to make a full recovery from the attack you suffered?"
    #20. 
    player_narration "Arden shifted slightly in his seat and frowned for a moment before forcing a smile."
    #21. 
    arden "I'm fine, thank you."
    #22. 
    ashel "Terrible business, that. If I ever happen to learn anything regarding the identity of your assailant, I will be sure to inform you."
    #23. 
    arden "Thank you, councillor."
    #24. 
    player_narration "Ashel pocketed the permits and then turned to leave, and I followed suit. As we approached the door and Ashel reached out to open it, a knock came from the other side a second before it opened inwards."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Standing in the doorway was Hellaren, with two of her Dahris colleagues behind her. Both she and Ashel were momentarily surprised to suddenly find themselves standing face-to-face, but they hid it well."
    #26. 
    player_narration "Although Ashel's smile was a formal one, I saw a hint of something else in it: satisfaction. Because even though the sorcery permit situation was humiliating for us..."
    #27. 
    player_narration "...at least we weren't alone in having to suffer that humiliation – the Dahris were being forced to as well."

    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically a study which is currently serving as the Lyris embassy while Councillor of Finance Ashel and his companions are in Belgran. The room contains some bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a couch, a desk and two chairs. Daylight enters through a couple of windows, and there is one wooden door, currently closed.

    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are on the main square in Lyr-Taer, the place filled with Lyris and decorated for a special occasion: the arrival of the Dahris ambassador and their party. Player-Character (PC) stands amongst the crowd.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was late morning and Lyr-Taer's main square was filled with people who'd turned up for today's special occasion, that being the arrival of a Dahris ambassador and their party."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The ambassador was visiting the city for a meeting with High Lord Tialas at the palace, although the exact nature of the meeting was a closely guarded secret."
    #3. 
    player_narration "What was common knowledge was that the Dahris visitors were due to enter the city and head to the main square, where they would be greeted by Councillor Ashel and a squad of Tialas' personal guards before being escorted to the palace."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Hence why the square had become the gathering place for so many of the city's inhabitants: they wanted to get a good look at the Dahris."
    #5. 
    player_narration "It was understandable given that many of them had probably never actually seen a Dahris with their own eyes before."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I stood amongst the crowd, having managed to pick myself out a spot which offered me a good view of both the square and many of the faces around me."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Some of those faces displayed curiosity, others excitement, while some of the Lyris present clearly disapproved or appeared outright hostile."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I'd heard snatches of conversation as I made my way through the crowd and wasn't surprised to hear some people criticising the Dahris visit..."
    #9. 
    player_narration "...declaring that "those filthy dark-skins"- not the only Dahris-aimed insult I overheard - shouldn't be allowed to set foot on Lyris soil, and that Tialas was weak and foolish for meeting with them."
    #10. 
    player_narration "There was plenty of gossip doing the rounds as well, such as the rumour that the Dahris party would have monsters travelling with them."
    #11. 
    player_narration "If any trouble did break out then the city guard were ready for it, with dozens of them being posted around the square, while a group of Tialas' personal guards waited in the centre with Councillor Ashel."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Over the general din of the crowd my ears picked up the faint, distant sound of hooves on stone, the noise approaching the square and growing louder."
    #13. 
    player_narration "I wasn't the only one to hear it: all across the square, voices began to fall silent and heads turned in the direction of the sound."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Movement in the crowd caught my eye and I watched as a young, angry-looking lyrian withdrew a large stone from one of his pockets and held it at the ready, apparently intending to throw it."
    #15. 
    player_narration "He didn't get the chance, however, as Sergeant Illinea appeared next to the lyrian from out of the crowd, grabbed his wrist and twisted it, dropping him to his knees and causing the stone to fall from his hand."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Another city guard arrived on the scene and Illinea shoved the hostile lyrian in his direction. The burly guard took hold of one of the lyrian's upper arms and dragged him away."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Illinea said nothing, although she gave the surrounding Lyris a look which spoke volumes. The people got the message and tried to look as little like troublemakers as possible. Illinea walked off, continuing her patrol."
    #18. 
    player_narration "I turned back towards the sound of approaching hooves to see two large, fine-looking carriages emerge from a connecting street and drive onto the square, each one pulled by a team of four horses."
    #19. 
    player_narration "People watched as the carriages moved towards the centre of the square. When the front carriage neared Ashel, both carriages came to a stop, the drivers remaining in their seats."
    #20. 
    player_narration "As the members of Tialas' personal guard stood to attention behind him, Ashel walked over to the front carriage and opened the door. He held out one hand, offering to help down the first person exiting the carriage."

    #Location: King Eadgar's Castle, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically the main hall. It is morning, the hall illuminated by daylight entering through several windows. Long tables covered in food and drink line the room and sitting at the tables are dozens of people, mostly Granians, although there are Lyris and Dahris present as well, including Councillor of Finance Ashel, Hellaren and Player-Character (PC). PC and Ashel sit next to each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "In the main hall of King Eadgar's castle, Councillor Ashel and myself and several other Lyris were just a few of the people in attendance at yet another feast, the hall's tables filled with Granians, us Lyris, and Hellaren and several of her Dahris colleagues."

    #11.

    PART E

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by numerous candles. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and eating as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is Meda. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir sit together at a table, drinking.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I had entered the Moon and Sabre to find it crammed with people continuing their hastilude celebrations, and even now, some time later, the festivities showed no sign of ending."
    #2. 
    player_narration "We'd managed to grab a corner table for ourselves when the previous occupants stumbled away from it. It was far enough away from the rowdiest customers that we could at least hear ourselves speak."
    #3. 
    player_narration "We drank our ales and discussed the day's events, and eventually the conversation turned to the subject of Annegard and his father. Elyndir seemed far from fond of the latter when he spoke about him."
    #4. 
    elyndir "Heimar may be a famous knight and the almighty Lord Marshal, but that man needs to get his act together when it comes to his son."
    #5. 
    player "To be fair, you don't know how much at fault he is, if at all. You know what children are like, maybe Annegard was just overreacting."
    #6. 
    elyndir "I don't think so. The boy was pretty adamant that his father was never there for him, was always too busy to really bother with him."
    #7. 
    elyndir "Again, Heimar's the lord marshal - it's not exactly a stretch to imagine he's neglecting his son in favour of his other duties, is it."
    #8. 
    elyndir "Look, I'm not one for children, most of the little bastards just get on my nerves. But I've met a lot worse than Annegard. The boy has potential, his father should be encouraging that."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Elyndir took a swallow of his ale. Heimar's apparent neglect of his son seemed to be a subject that struck a chord with the dahrian. I decided to pursue that possibility to see where it led."
    #10. 
    player "Did you go through something similar when you were young?"
    #11. 
    player_narration "Elyndir's expression was grave as he glanced at me then looked off across the room. Several seconds passed and just as I began to think he wasn't going to give me any kind of answer at all, he spoke."
    #12. 
    elyndir "I grew up without a father. Mine abandoned my mother and me before I was born."
    #13. 
    elyndir "When I was young I got into a lot of fights with other children, the ones who teased me about having no father. Like you said, you know what children are like."
    #14. 
    elyndir "My mother did her best for me and I've always been grateful for that, but still, it was hard at times."
    #15. 
    player "But you made it through. And your mother must have done something right, you turned out alright."
    #16. 
    elyndir "There are corpses who'd disagree with that. If they could."
    #17. 
    elyndir "Anyway, enough about me. What about your family?"
    #18. 
    player "Not much to tell, really. Fairly normal, I suppose. My mother and father have a house back in Lyriathis, the same place where I grew up. She's an alchemist, he's a healer."
    #19. 
    elyndir "Is he any good? I've met people who called themselves healers but had more in common with butchers."
    #20. 
    player "Yes, he's good at it. He's been doing it a long time."
    #21. 
    player "I have a brother, Olin. He's older than me. He's a captain in the Lyriathis military."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Elyndir's eyes narrowed slightly and he looked at me with mild suspicion."
    #23. 
    elyndir "You didn't tell me you were connected to the Lyriathis authorities."
    #24. 
    player "Relax, I don't tell him everything I'm up to. If I was trying to hide that from you for some reason then I wouldn't have just told you, would I."
    #25. 
    player_narration "After a moment Elyndir relaxed again and drank some of his ale."
    #26. 
    elyndir "Alright. Just make sure you don't feel the need to share any details about our working relationship with your brother. As you can imagine, I'm not all that keen on dealing with the authorities, whatever the country."
    #27. 
    player "Don't worry."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I finished what ale I had left and then nodded in the direction of Elyndir's tankard."
    #29.

    #Plot by Katja Alexeeva

    #Script by Alex De-Gruchy




    #Location: Main square, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are on the main square in Belgran. It is the day of the Fish Rain Festival and so numerous stalls, activities and events have been set up all around the square. The place is filled with men, women and children, and there are also some Lyris among them. Player-Character (PC) walks amongst the crowd.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I wandered among the vast crowd of Granians who filled Belgran's main square, the heart of the city alive with music, song, laughter and conversation."
    #2. 
    player_narration "It was a day of celebration as the capital city held its annual Fish Rain Festival, the square filled with decorations, stalls and a number of different activities and distractions to keep the people entertained."
    #3. 
    player_narration "When I'd first heard the name of the festival I'd been confused, my mind immediately conjuring the image of a rain of fish falling from the sky and onto the streets and buildings of Belgran."
    #4. 
    player_narration "But when I asked a local woman about it, she explained that because Belgran was a port town, with fish naturally playing a large part in the city's economy and in the day-to-day lives of many of its citizens..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...the festival was a time to give thanks for the ocean's bounty and to wish for the ocean to continue providing for the city in the year to come."
    #6. 
    player_narration "That explained the "fish"part of the name, anyway. As for how "rain"came into it, the woman went on to reveal that on the day of the festival a dance was held for the young women of Belgran..."
    #7. 
    player_narration "...one which saw individual girls dancing in slots of three minutes each, and if it should start to rain at any point during the event then the girl dancing at that time was seen as being blessed by Jessamine, the goddess of the sea."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I still thought it was a strange choice of name for the festival – and personally I didn't see the big appeal in being rained on – but at least the woman's explanation made sense."
    #9. 
    player_narration "At the moment the sky was blanketed with slate-grey cloud as far as the eye could see, and this certainly seemed to be enhancing people's enjoyment of the festival as I kept seeing Granians glancing upwards with expectant expressions."
    #10. 
    player_narration "I passed several long tables covered in large plates, each one offering a different fish-based dish: I'd never seen so many different fish cooked in so many different ways before."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Everything looked delicious and many nearby Granians were helping themselves. I made a mental note to return and try some of the dishes myself once I'd done a little more exploring."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Soon I came across the large, cordoned-off area where a wooden stage had been erected and on which the young women's dance was to be held. In fact I seemed to be just in time to watch it begin."
    #13. 
    player_narration "A large number of eager young women stood around the edges of the dancefloor, each with a sheet of paper attached to her back. Written on each sheet was a different number, these representing the order in which the girls would dance."
    #14. 
    player_narration "A nearby woman who seemed to be one of the people in charge of the event rang a bell, the sound of it carrying across the square, and the first of the dancers made her way out onto the dancefloor."

    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and talking as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is Meda.

    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically a study which is currently serving as the Lyris embassy while Councillor of Finance Ashel and his companions are in Belgran. The room contains some bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a couch, a desk and two chairs. It is night, the room illuminated by several lanterns. There is one wooden door, currently closed.

    player_narration "Now, having just come to the end of my story, Ashel leaned back in his chair and stared through me with a thoughtful frown. After a few seconds, his eyes met mine again."

    #10.22.
    player_narration "The prospect of a human bard and not a lyris one playing at Tialas' anniversary clearly irked some people... "#(GO TO 10.23.)
    #10.23.
    player_narration "...but I knew that the chances of that actually happening were slim to none, deserving or not – politics and tradition would see to that. Either way, I had to admire Dewi's courage for competing in the first place. "#(GO TO 10.24.)

    #10.26.
    player_narration "His choice of song was upbeat and energetic, contrasting nicely with the opening song from Sannah. There was no weeping in the crowd this time, mostly just people smiling, many nodding their heads in time to the music. "#(GO TO 10.27.)
    #10.27.
    player_narration "When Dewi finished his song, he received a warmer reaction than the one which had greeted him, and he deserved it. He waved at the crowd then left the stage. "#(GO TO 10.28.)

    #● Dewi leaves the stage before Alane walks to the front of the stage again.
    #10.28.
    player_narration "The rest of the day went on like that, with fifteen-minute breaks being called after every five contestants, many members of the crowd using this time to buy a fresh drink or food, or use one of the nearby public toilets. "#(GO TO 10.29.)

    #10.29.

    PART C

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The inn is busy, the room filled with customers eating, drinking and talking. Player-Character (PC) and Yandar are working behind the counter. Standing opposite PC, on the other side of the counter, is Lathien.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Later that evening, not long after the end of the preliminary round of the bard contest, I was busy helping Yandar at the Golden Meadow, the inn understandably crowded after the day's festivities."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Expecting a surge of customers, Yandar had asked me in advance if I would help out for a few hours. I told him I would."
    #3. 
    player_narration "About an hour into my shift, Lathien had entered and taken a place at the counter, acknowledging me and Yandar before ordering an ale for himself. He had clearly already had a few drinks beforehand but he wasn't properly drunk. Yet."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Soon afterwards, I was offered a brief respite when no other customers needed anything for the moment. Noticing this, Lathien caught my eye and beckoned me. I walked over to him."
    #5. 
    player_narration "As I reached Lathien, Yandar grabbed a couple of mugs from one of the lower shelves behind me, looking briefly at the bard as he did so."
    #6. 
    yandar "I hear you're through to the next round of the contest. Congratulations."
    #7. 
    lathien "Thank you. It was never in any doubt."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Yandar turned away, rolling his eyes. He returned to the far end of the counter to continue serving a customer. Lathien focused his attention on me."
    #9. 
    player_narration "A few seconds passed as Lathien stared at me. He seemed to be waiting for me to speak, but it was he who eventually broke the silence."
    #10. 
    lathien "Well? What did you think?"
    #11. 
    player "It was a good day, there were a lot of talented bards. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. I think most of them still are."
    #12. 
    player "I have to say, I'm surprised you came in here alone. What happened to your friends? I assumed you'd all be painting the town red."
    #13. 
    lathien "I got bored of them. They're fun and everything, but I fancied a change of company so I snuck off."
    #14. 
    player "Well, I hope you don't expect me to fawn over you like some of your friends were doing. You already get enough of that."
    #15. 
    lathien "Wouldn't dream of it. Anyway, that wasn't really what I meant. What I was asking was: what did you think of my performance?"
    #16. 
    player_narration "I paused for a moment before answering. I didn't want to offend or upset Lathien but ultimately I wasn't going to lie to him just to spare his ego."
    #17. 
    player "In all honesty? It wasn't especially bad, but it was still one of the weakest performances I've ever seen you give. You weren't great, and I think a number of bards who didn't make it through deserved your place more than you did."
    #18. 
    player_narration "Lathien raised one eyebrow and chuckled."
    #19. 
    lathien "Please, don't hold anything back, will you."
    #20. 
    player "You asked me what I thought."
    #21. 
    lathien "I did. And believe me, I'm not hurt. What, you don't think I could've won today if I really wanted to?"
    #22. 
    player "Well then, why didn't you?"
    #23. 
    lathien "Because I have a plan, [PLAYER NAME]. That's why."
    #24. 
    lathien "You see, I know for a fact that the twenty bards who went through today are going to be pitted against each other in ten head-to-head battles in the next stage of the contest."
    #25. 
    lathien "Now, each bard will be facing off against the bard who came ten places above or below them. So that means whoever came first faces off against whoever came eleventh, second-place faces off against twelfth-place, and so on."
    #26. 
    lathien "Don't ask me why they're doing it like this, but I know they are. So with this in mind, rather than playing to win the preliminary round, I thought I'd aim for somewhere between fifth and tenth place..."
    #27. 
    lathien "...because then in the next round, I'd be facing off against one of the weaker bards, someone who only just made it through, increasing my chances of beating them in the head-to-head."
    #28. 
    player "If you were capable of winning today then surely you wouldn't need any help in the next round, you'd be able to beat anyone you went up against."
    #29. 
    lathien "Even so, I'm not stupid enough to turn down an advantage if I can gain one."
    #30. 
    player "Your plan seems unnecessarily convoluted. Not to mention risky – if you'd come eleventh, you'd have ended up facing off against the winner in the next round, which would've been no advantage at all."
    #31. 
    player "And it could've been even worse. You gave a mediocre performance on purpose, yeah? What if that had put you outside of the first twenty places today? Then  you wouldn't have gone through to the next round at all."
    #32. 
    player_narration "Lathien shrugged, smiling, before taking a swallow of his ale."
    #33. 
    lathien "It was a calculated risk. And it couldn't have gone better – by landing tenth place, that's going to put me against the bard who came twentieth today. I like my odds."
    #34. 
    player "Whatever you say, Lathien. I'm glad your plan's working out for you."
    #35. 
    lathien "I told you I was going to win this contest and secure my place in history. And that's no fanciful bard's tale, [PLAYER NAME]. That's cold, hard truth."
    #36. 
    player_narration "The look on Lathien's face told me he meant what he said. "

    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. The square is packed with people who have come to watch the first proper round of the bard contest. The wooden stage from the preliminary round remains in place, and standing on the stage are Alane and Myrileyn. The competing bards – twenty of them, all lyris apart from two humans – are mixed in amongst the crowd. Lathien is one of these bards. Player-Character (PC) stands amongst the crowd as well, facing the stage.
    #1. 
    player_narration "When I arrived at the main square, the place was as packed as I'd expected it to be, the square and connecting streets crowded with people who had come to watch the continuation of the bard contest."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The shops which lined the square were once again keen to take advantage of any potential extra business, as were the food- and drink-sellers who wandered amongst the crowd."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I claimed a spot granting me a decent view of the stage, standing on which was Alane, the Lyr-Taer School of Arts director, who was once again judging the contest."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Unlike the preliminary round, however, Alane wouldn't be the sole judge this time around. Standing next to her on the stage was Lady Myrileyn, Alane's co-judge for this round of the contest."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Looking as highborn and refined as you'd expect of the High Lord's daughter, Myrileyn stood close to Alane, the two of them leaning in towards each other slightly as they spoke. "
    #6. 
    player_narration "The gazes of Alane and Myrileyn alternated between each other and the crowd, the former wearing a composed expression, giving nothing away, while the latter, unlike almost everyone else present, appeared a little disinterested."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The twenty bards who had made it through the preliminary round – eighteen lyris and two humans – stood near the stage. A handful of them mingled with each other but most kept their distance from their rivals."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Every bard was holding a musical instrument – there would be no poems today, it would seem, only songs."

    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The inn is busy, the room filled with customers eating, drinking and talking.

    #5. 
    player_narration "I handed Lathien the fresh drink he'd ordered and we began to talk. I congratulated him on making it through to the semi-final round and of course he replied that it was never in any doubt, he had everything in hand, and so on."

    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. The square is packed with people who have come to watch the second round of the bard contest. The wooden stage from the previous rounds remains in place, and standing on the stage is Alane, who is once again acting as judge. Her fellow judge is the current Archmage (either Dahenwar or Alirienne, depending on the player's previous actions). The competing bards – but only eight of them, the remaining two are missing – are mixed in amongst the crowd. Lathien is one of these bards. Player-Character (PC) stands amongst the crowd as well, facing the stage.

    PART A

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is early morning, the room illuminated by the daylight that enters through the windows. PC is standing in the doorway that connects the main room to the rest of the inn, facing into the room. Standing near the counter are Lathien and Yandar, who face each other as they talk. There are a handful of customers sitting at some of the tables.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I woke with a start in my room at the Golden Meadow Inn, and as I lay in bed, rubbing my eyes and stretching my limbs as I cleared the sleep from my head, I quickly realised why."
    #2. 
    player_narration "There was some kind of commotion occurring in the main room downstairs, one loud enough to have woken me from a deep sleep. I heard a raised voice, almost shouting, along with the bang of some kind of impact."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I dressed quickly and left my room before descending the stairs carefully and quietly, unsure of what awaited me in the adjoining room at the foot of the stairs."

    #4.1.
    player_narration "As I neared the ground floor, the raised voice within the main room became loud enough for me to hear clearly and recognise its owner: Lathien. "#(GO TO 4.2.)
    #4.2.
    player_narration "He was shouting at someone, yelling something about the bard contest, and whoever was on the receiving end of his furious ranting was unable to get a word in. "#(GO TO 4.3.)
    #4.3.
    player_narration "I stepped into the doorway of the room and surveyed the scene before me. Lathien's face was twisted in a mask of rage as he stamped around the floor, gesturing with his arms. "#(GO TO 4.4.)
    #4.4.
    player_narration "He was glaring at Yandar, who looked back at him with an apologetic expression. "#(GO TO 4.5.)
    #4.5.
    player_narration "I could see that Lathien was holding something in each hand, but with his frequent and violent gesturing it took me a moment to realise what he held: a thoroughly smashed lute and some shredded clothing. "#(GO TO 4.6.)
    #4.6.
    player_narration "I also spotted one of the inn's stools lying broken on the floor next to the counter, and assumed this was the source of the loud bang I'd heard from upstairs, with Lathien having taken out some of his anger on the stool. "#(GO TO 4.7.)
    #4.7.
    player_narration "Lathien and Yandar weren't the only people present. Yandar opened the inn's doors early, and customers would often call in for breakfast or a drink before going off to work or whatever else they had planned for the day. "#(GO TO 4.8.)
    #4.8.

    #4.10.

    player_narration "Focusing on me now, Lathien stormed across the room in my direction. I stood my ground, holding his gaze. "#(GO TO 4.12.)

    #4.31.
    lathien "Five minutes later, I get back to my room and lo and behold, someone has gone in and smashed up my lute and torn up my clothes! They were watching me and just waiting for their chance, the sneaky little bastard! "#(GO TO 4.32.)
    #4.32.
    player "And there was no sign of whoever did it? Didn't you hear anything while you were in the bathroom? "#(GO TO 4.33.)
    #4.33.
    lathien "No, I didn't hear anything, otherwise I would've run back to my room and beaten the shit out of whoever was in there, wouldn't I! "#(GO TO 4.34.)

    illinea "Bryn said he had some old spares he could use, although he wasn't happy about doing so. "#(GO TO 6.22.)
    #6.22.
    illinea "And as for Mahrys, well, she didn't actually suffer as much damage as you other three seem to have done. Her best dress, the one she was going to wear today, was badly slashed... "#(GO TO 6.23.)

    #6.31.
    player_narration "There was a moment of tense silence in which Yandar and I glanced at each other while Lathien and Illinea held each other's gaze. The silence was finally broken by Illinea, her professionalism overcoming her annoyance. "#(GO TO 6.32.)
    #6.32.

    #6.33.
    lathien "Oh, I'll be competing, alright. And I'll be winning. Apparently Yandar can't run a secure inn but he is very kindly going to open his till and pay for a brand-new lute and outfit for me. "#(GO TO 6.34.)
    #6.34.

    PART B

    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. The square is packed with people who have come to watch the final round of the bard contest. The wooden stage from the previous rounds remains in place, and standing on the stage is Alane, who is once again acting as judge. Standing on either side of Alane are her fellow judges: the current Archmage (either Dahenwar or Alirienne, depending on the player's previous actions) and Myrileyn. High Lord Tialas is also present, although he is already seated in a private seating area facing the stage. The four finalists, Lathien included, are standing in a row at the rear of the stage, facing the crowd. Player-Character (PC) stands amongst the crowd, facing the stage.
    #1. 
    player_narration "When I reached the outskirts of Lyr-Taer's main square, I was forced to squeeze and jostle my way through the dense crowd to find a spot with a decent view of the stage, such was the turn-out for the final round of the bard contest."
    #2. 
    player_narration "There was noise and movement everywhere, with lyris of all ages and walks of life having converged on and filled the square."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I wasn't surprised as it was a big occasion for the city, one which had remained a popular talking point amongst its people from the beginning of the contest."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Standing near the front of the stage was Alane, who was joined by both of her previous co-judges, Lady Myrileyn and Archmage [Dahenwar / Alirienne]."
    #5. 
    player_narration "The three of them were discussing something, Alane and the Archmage wearing formal expressions on their faces while Myrileyn appeared only half-interested in the conversation."
    #6. 
    player_narration "The guest of honour was High Lord Tialas himself, although he wasn't onstage but was instead seated in his own private booth nearby, one offering him a clear view of the stage and which was ringed by members of the city guard."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Behind the three judges, standing in a row near the rear of the stage, were the four bards competing in this final round: Lathien, Bryn, Nohrel and Mahrys."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I didn't know how much money Yandar had given to Lathien earlier that morning for a replacement lute and new clothing, but it had apparently been enough for Lathien to outshine the other bards."
    #9. 
    player_narration "His outfit was made of fine material formed into an even finer design, one which complimented him well, and his new lute was sleek and polished, of a clearly high quality."
    #10. 
    player_narration "The same couldn't be said of his rivals, who, in their replacement attire – and in the cases of Bryn and Nohrel, with replacement instruments – appeared plain in comparison."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Mahrys' original harp stood before her, and even if it had not been as thoroughly damaged as the other finalists' instruments had, it still appeared very ordinary next to Lathien's new lute."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Although the four bards were smiling, it seemed to be more for the sake of the crowd as each one occasionally cast a suspicious, sideways glance at the others..."
    #13. 
    player_narration "...no doubt wondering which of their rivals, if any, had something to do with the break-ins."
    #14. 
    player_narration "As for myself, I studied their faces as keenly as I could from this distance, but none of them exhibited any overt signs of guilt. I wondered how Sergeant Illinea's investigation was going."
    #15. 
    player_narration "It wasn't long before the focus of my thoughts returned to the stage – their discussion over, Alane, Myrileyn and [Dahenwar / Alirienne] walked to the front of the stage and looked out over the crowd. A hush descended."
    #16. 
    alane "Citizens of Lyr-Taer and all of Lyriathis beyond, welcome to this, the final round of the contest to choose a bard to perform at the celebration marking five-hundred years of High Lord Tialas' leadership."
    #17. 
    alane "We are especially honoured today as the High Lord himself is present to watch the proceedings."
    #18.

    #19.

    player_narration "Myrileyn and the Archmage each gave the crowd a polite smile but no more than that, and Alane soon continued."
    #21. 
    alane "Today, each of the four finalists will perform an original song they have written in honour of the upcoming anniversary."
    #22. 
    alane "Also, following their initial performance, each bard will then be given a different theme and will have to choose from their repertoire a song which they feel best suits the theme in question."
    #23. 
    alane "Please welcome the first of today's finalists: Bryn."
    #24. 
    player_narration "Alane, Myrileyn and [Dahenwar / Alirienne] left the stage as Bryn walked to the front of it, the crowd welcoming him with enthusiastic applause and cheering."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Bryn had a strong voice which he was no doubt relying on to make the biggest impression today, as his simple clothing and lute wouldn't be doing that for him."
    #26. 
    player_narration "His anniversary song was a powerful and sweeping one, and it was well-received by the crowd. When it was over, he returned to the rear of the stage and Alane appeared briefly to introduce the second bard: Nohrel."
    #27. 
    player_narration "Playing a violin and possessing a fairly high voice, Nohrel was a more restrained and subtle performer than Bryn, but no less talented. On a good day, that is – and today didn't seem to be a very good day for him."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I assumed the crime of which he had been a victim had rattled Nohrel, as his nerves were evident during his performance, his voice struggling to hit some of the higher notes while his violin-playing lacked enthusiasm."
    #29. 
    player_narration "He received moderate applause as he returned to the rear of the stage, but before he turned away, Nohrel's expression suggested that he wasn't pleased with how his first song had gone."
    #30. 
    player_narration "Next up was Lathien, who delivered yet another energetic and passionate performance, one complimented by his stylish outfit and finely-crafted lute."
    #31. 
    player_narration "Lathien's song went down well and he seemed satisfied and confident as he returned to his place at the rear of the stage."
    #32. 
    player_narration "Then Alane introduced the final contestant, Mahrys. Despite having to follow Lathien with a damaged harp and simple, plain clothing, Mahrys seemed undaunted as she and her instrument arrived at the front of the stage."
    #33. 
    player_narration "And indeed she delivered an impressive performance which was only briefly marred near its conclusion when one of her harp strings suddenly snapped. Even so, she barely missed a beat and managed to finish the song."
    #34. 
    player_narration "As Mahrys returned to her spot, Alane announced a brief interval before the second part of the round would begin."
    #35. 
    player_narration "And so the crowd milled around for a little while, some eating or drinking but most simply talking – or arguing – about how the first part of the round had gone."
    #36. 
    player_narration "At one point I glanced up at the stage just in time to see Lathien lean towards Bryn and say something with a sly smile on his lips."
    #37. 
    player_narration "I couldn't tell what Lathien had said, but Bryn's only reply was a brief, angry look in his direction. Lathien said nothing more but the same smile remained on his face for a time."
    #38. 
    player_narration "When Alane eventually returned to the stage, she once again called forth Bryn. The bard walked to her side and then she announced that the theme for his second song would be "Distant lands.""
    #39. 
    player_narration "As Alane left the stage again, Bryn looked off across the square for a moment, deep in thought. Then an idea seemed to come to him and he smiled."
    #40. 
    player_narration "He began to play the song which he deemed the best fit for his given theme, and it turned out to be one which a large number of people in the crowd knew and liked."
    #41. 
    player_narration "If Lathien had been trying to rattle Bryn with whatever he said to him then clearly it hadn't worked, as Bryn's performance was a strong one which received a large amount of applause from the crowd upon its conclusion."
    #42. 
    player_narration "Nohrel came next, Alane announcing to both him and the crowd that the theme for his second song would be "Wisdom."Nohrel nodded, although he seemed unsure."
    #43. 
    player_narration "Nohrel played a song that fit his theme and although it was a fairly well-known one, he didn't quite do it justice, his nerves once again showing through in both his voice and violin-playing."
    #44. 
    player_narration "When the song was over, Nohrel gave a stiff bow and then hurriedly returned to the rear of the stage."
    #45. 
    player_narration "Nohrel was replaced by Lathien, who was told by Alane that his theme would be "Forbidden love."There was barely a pause before Lathien smiled – apparently he already had something in mind."
    #46. 
    player_narration "Lathien was as impressive as he had been earlier, his choice of song being very popular amongst the crowd, the song given increased life and energy by his performance."
    #47. 
    player_narration "At the end, Lathien grinned and bowed, and even blew a kiss to the crowd. He seemed confident, but then he had a right to be."
    #48. 
    player_narration "Finally came Mahrys, whose theme Alane announced to be "Springtime.""
    #49. 
    player_narration "Even with her harp missing its snapped string, Mahrys did an admirable job with her chosen song, a bright and cheerful tune which ended the competition on a positive note."
    #50. 
    player_narration "Mahrys returned to stand alongside the other bards while Alane announced another short interval before the results would be revealed."
    #51. 
    player_narration "Even before Alane had left the stage, the square hummed louder than ever with excited discussion, and it only began to quiet again when she returned, once again accompanied by Myrileyn and Archmage [Dahenwar / Alirienne]."
    #52. 
    player_narration "The three judges stood at the front of the stage. Alane turned to face the four bards and beckoned them towards her."
    #53. 
    player_narration "The finalists walked forward and came to a stop near the judges, the crowd applauding them as they did. Alane once again turned to face the square."
    #54. 
    alane "These four bards stand here today because they have proven their talent and commitment, and they should be proud of themselves, as we are all proud of them."
    #55. 
    alane "But as we know, only one can be declared winner and go on to perform at High Lord Tialas' anniversary celebration. And so the final results are as follows..."
    #56. 
    alane "In fourth place: Nohrel."
    #57. 
    player_narration "As the crowd applauded him, Nohrel gave a brief wave and then turned to thank the judges, smiling politely. Although he seemed disappointed, he didn't seem surprised."
    #58. 
    alane "In third place: Mahrys."
    #59. 
    player_narration "Like Nohrel, Mahrys accepted her result with polite grace even though her disappointment was clear. That left Bryn and Lathien, both of whom stood waiting expectantly. Like them, the crowd was silent but eager."
    #60. 
    alane "In second place: Lathien."
    #61. 
    player_narration "As the people in the square applauded and cheered, Lathien didn't move. Instead he simply stood and looked off into space, blinking, with a small frown on his face, as if unsure of what he had just heard."
    #62. 
    player_narration "Then a grinning Bryn clapped him on one of his shoulders and that seemed to startle Lathien back to his senses. He looked around, still slightly disbelieving, as the judges moved their attention onto Bryn."
    #63. 
    player_narration "The applause and cheering which had greeted Lathien's name didn't die down now but instead intensified as Alane turned to Bryn. She had to raise her voice to be heard."
    #64. 
    alane "And the winner of the contest: Bryn."
    #65. 
    player_narration "Grinning triumphantly, Bryn raised both arms, waving at the crowd before thanking the judges and briefly acknowledging his defeated rivals."
    #66. 
    player_narration "While Nohrel and Mahrys gave Bryn some polite applause and forced smiles, Lathien stared down at the floor before him, his expression as hard and cold as stone."
    #67. 
    player_narration "Alane reiterated the details of the prize Bryn had won: the opportunity to perform at Tialas' upcoming anniversary celebration before the High Lord, his family, the members of the High Council, and other esteemed guests."
    #68. 
    player_narration "The judges and contestants remained onstage for a moment longer as Alane thanked the crowd, all of the bards who had competed, her fellow judges, and the people who had worked to organise the contest."
    #69. 
    player_narration "Then she and Myrileyn and [Dahenwar / Alirienne] left the stage, the four bards following behind them. Bryn, Nohrel and Mahrys each gave the people in the square one final wave while Lathien only walked and stared ahead."
    #70. 
    player_narration "The stage now empty, the applause and cheering finally began to die down as many people in the crowd turned to each other to share their thoughts on the final results."
    #71. 
    player_narration "As I passed through the crowd on my way out of the square, I heard arguments for and against the judges' results, although most people seemed to agree that Bryn had performed well and earned his victory."

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The inn is busy, the room filled with people celebrating the conclusion of the bard contest. Player-Character (PC) is working alone behind the counter – there is no sign of Yandar.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Yandar had asked if I'd work on the evening of the final round of the bard contest, as the inn was bound to be busy with people celebrating the contest's conclusion."
    #2. 
    player_narration "As such, I'd spent the last several hours serving food and drink alongside Yandar. The atmosphere had remained cheerful, any arguments concerning the results of the contest being good-natured ones."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Someone who was – understandably – far from cheerful, however, was Lathien."
    #4. 
    player_narration "He'd entered through the front door about fifteen minutes ago, slightly unsteady on his feet and with an ugly frown on his face – it had been hours since the end of the contest, he must have been off drinking somewhere since then."
    #5. 
    player_narration "He lurched across the room, heading for the stairs, ignoring those people who attempted to speak to him."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Those whose attentions Lathien ignored shrugged and went back to their drinks and conversations as he disappeared upstairs, presumably going to his room."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I glanced over at Yandar to see him looking in Lathien's direction with a troubled frown. I assumed he just didn't want the drunk and disappointed bard causing any trouble."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Soon afterwards came a brief lull at the counter, the majority of customers not in need of any service for at least a little while, and it was then that Yandar excused himself for a moment before heading upstairs."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Thinking of how Lathien must feel after having come so close to achieving his goal only to have it snatched from him, I wondered if I should try to cheer him up."

    #11.1.
    player_narration "Surrounded as I was by drink, I thought of one of Lathien's favourites, a cocktail – only slightly alcoholic – named Mellow Sunshine. Although he didn't drink it often, he'd said that was only because he liked to savour it when he did. "#(GO TO 11.2.)
    #11.2.

    #11.7.

    #11.10.
    player_narration "Occasionally his talking threatened to turn into shouting but he caught himself every time he seemed about to lose his temper and lowered his voice accordingly, presumably so as not to be heard. But I could hear him. "#(GO TO 11.11.)

    #21. 
    yandar "The Kiartar don't bother with sorcery, so they've got no shared interest there; geographically, Dahraith and Kron-Gantir are pretty far apart, so there'd be no combining into one big territory..."

    yandar "...and the Kiartar aren't renowned for being warriors, while the Dahris are a bloodthirsty lot. It's a total mismatch."

    #24. 
    player_narration "Yandar looked down the counter at Sergeant Illinea, who was standing alone and holding a mug of ale in one hand. She was close enough that she must have overheard our conversation, although she showed no interest in it."

    #● We are on the outskirts of Belgran and it is sometime during the morning. Player-Character (PC) is entering the capital city for the first time. There are many other people around, all Granians. A pair of Belgran watchmen stand beside the gate through which PC is entering the city.

    PART B

    #Location: Jail cells, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are inside one of Belgran's jails. Player-Character (PC) occupies one of the cells and is sitting on the bed with his back against the wall. The front wall of the cell consists of a row of vertical metal bars, and a hallway runs past these bars. A small, barred window high up in the wall allows some daylight into PC's cell.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was late morning and I'd spent my first day in Belgran in a jail cell after being thrown in here by that corrupt watchman yesterday."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd tried to get some rest overnight, but after a few hours of fitful sleep on an uncomfortable straw mattress, I gave up and simply sat with my back against a stone wall as the sun rose and my cell gradually lightened."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Although I hadn't seen the watchman since, I had seen a couple of his colleagues pass by the row of metal bars that made up the front wall of my cell. None of them spoke to me."
    #4. 
    player_narration "A few of the nearby cells were occupied by other prisoners, one of whom had been drunkenly ranting – and occasionally singing – for some time the previous evening. I'd thanked the gods when he finally passed out."
    #5. 
    player_narration "As the morning went on, I continued to sit and wait. I told myself not to be soured on Belgran and its people just because of a pair of greedy and corrupt watchmen."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I heard a heavy door open and close, and then two pairs of feet began approaching along the hallway that ran alongside the front of my cell. Then a surprisingly familiar face appeared."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Councillor of Finance Ashel came to a stop outside my cell and looked at me through the bars with an annoyed expression. Next to him stood a Belgran watchman. I rose to my feet and walked towards the front of the cell."
    #8. 
    player "Councillor Ashel? What are you doing here?"
    #9. 
    ashel "Wasting my morning rounding up troublesome strays, apparently."
    #10. 
    ashel "I am currently in Belgran on important business, and was informed earlier this morning that a citizen of Lyriathis was occupying a cell in one of the city jails."
    #11. 
    ashel "While your inappropriate behaviour was hardly enough to cause an international incident, it's still something that would be best resolved quickly and discreetly, and I am here to see to that."
    #12. 
    player "My behaviour? I'm going to take a wild guess that the authorities haven't filled you in on the details, then."
    #13. 
    player "The gate I entered the city through yesterday – the two Belgran watchmen guarding it tried to cheat me, just because I was a Lyris. When I refused to let them, I was arrested and thrown in here."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Ashel sighed and looked away as if to say, "Some people never learn."Clearly he wasn't interested in hearing my side of the story."
    #15. 
    ashel "The details are unimportant. What matters – and for which you should be very grateful – is that I have resolved the situation and you are now free to leave."
    #16. 
    ashel "You will cause no further difficulties for the Belgran authorities during your stay, of course. I – and by extension High Lord Tialas – would take a very dim view should you decide to do otherwise."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Ashel looked at the watchman and nodded. The watchman inserted a thick metal key into the door of my cell and opened it. I was free."
    #18. 
    player_narration "For a moment, however, I didn't move. Instead I stood where I was, fuming. It wasn't right – I hadn't done anything wrong, I shouldn't have been in this damn cell in the first place."
    #19. 
    player_narration "But as Ashel had said, he didn't care about the details. And without his help, I had no idea when I'd be getting out of here... so I knew I'd just have to take what I could get in this case."
    #20. 
    player_narration "I exited the cell and thanked the councillor, silently hoping that my unpleasant introduction to Belgran wasn't a sign of things to come for the rest of my stay. "

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. Yandar stands behind the bar while a number of customers are scattered around the room, eating, drinking and talking. Player-Character (PC) stands just inside the room's entrance, the door behind him. It is late afternoon, the room illuminated by daylight.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I arrived in Lyr-Taer to find that the capital city appeared much the same as I remembered it from years before, although this didn't take away from how sprawling and impressive it remained."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Its streets, courtyards and parks were bustling with life as the city's inhabitants, not to mention the many visitors such as myself, went about their business."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The city felt vibrant and alive, and ripe with potential opportunities. Part of me knew I should temper my expectations but I chose to ignore that part and instead let my mind swim with thoughts of what might lay ahead for me."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I didn't manage to do any real exploring of Lyr-Taer, however, as I only walked a few streets before I suddenly realised just how tired the journey to the city had made me."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Deciding that a stroll around the capital could wait until tomorrow, I asked a passing lyrian if he knew of a good inn where I could rent a room. He recommended the Golden Meadow Inn, where I now found myself."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I had little experience with inns but the place seemed decent enough from what I could tell, and was currently fairly busy with the afternoon crowd."
    #7. 
    player_narration "A lyrian who might have been a decade or two older than Olin was working behind the counter. Given that he was the only staff I could see, I crossed the room in his direction."

    #● PC walks over to the counter and comes to a stop before it, facing it and Yandar. Yandar turns to face PC.
    #8. 
    player_narration "The lyrian was cleaning a cup with a cloth as I walked up to the counter. When he met my eyes, he set the cup aside and gave me a welcoming smile."
    #9. 
    player "Hello."
    #10. 
    yandar "Afternoon, [sir / miss]. Beautiful day, isn't it? How can I help you?"
    #11. 
    player "I was wondering if I could rent a room for the night."
    #12. 
    yandar "Absolutely, we have a few available. Our rate is twenty gold per night."
    #13. 
    player "That's fine, I'll take a room."
    #14. 
    player_narration "I counted out the correct amount of gold and handed the money to the lyrian. He checked it and pocketed it before handing me a key. Attached to the key was a small wooden tag with a "3"carved into it."
    #15. 
    yandar "Here you go. You're in room 3 – it's upstairs and on the right, you can't miss it."
    #16. 
    yandar "My name's Yandar and I'm the owner of this fine establishment. If you need anything or have any problems, just let me know. I'm here to help."
    #17. 
    player "I will, thank you."
    #18. 
    yandar "I hope you enjoy your stay."
    #19. 
    player_narration "I nodded and turned to leave the counter, intending to find the room in which I'd be spending the night, but as I was about to walk away, Yandar spoke again."
    #20. 
    yandar "By the way, if you need any food or drink, feel free to come on down, pull up a chair and browse the menu."
    #21. 
    yandar "We've got a range of dishes guaranteed to silence a rumbling belly and plenty of drinks to quench a gasping thirst."
    #22. 
    yandar "And, well, not to blow my own trumpet too loudly but you really haven't lived until you've sampled my spicy beef stew or my cream scones."
    #23. 
    player "I'd like to settle into my room first but I might come down for something later."
    #24. 
    player_narration "Again I turned to leave and again Yandar spoke just as I was about to walk away."
    #25. 
    yandar "If you'll be around and you're interested, I actually teach baking classes during the last week of every month."
    #26. 
    yandar "Even if you know your way around a kitchen, I'm sure I could teach you a few things. I've made cakes so beautiful they'd make the gods weep."
    #27. 
    player "Well, you sound like quite the cook. If I decide to expand my baking expertise then I'll be sure to sign up for a class."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I turned and began to leave the counter, feeling safe in the assumption that Yandar had now said everything he had to say. Before I could take a step, however, he proved me wrong."
    #29. 
    yandar "One other thing..."
    #30. 
    player_narration "As he began speaking – again – I turned back to him and raised my eyebrows, not hiding my exasperation and diminishing patience."
    #31. 
    player "Yes...?"
    #32. 
    yandar "If you're new in Lyr-Taer, I don't suppose you're looking for work, are you?"
    #33. 
    yandar "I ask because I'm looking to hire someone to help me out with running the inn. Business is good enough that to be honest I'm struggling to keep up, so having an extra pair of hands around the place would be a big help."
    #34. 
    yandar "The work would be part-time and simple enough: some cleaning, helping me with deliveries, serving customers, that sort of stuff."
    #35. 
    player_narration "The work did sound straightforward enough, and of course the money would be useful, but I didn't want to give Yandar a definite answer one way or the other right away."
    #36. 
    player "I might be interested. Do you mind if I have a think about it and then let you know?"
    #37. 
    yandar "Of course, no problem."
    #38. 
    player_narration "I nodded, smiling, and then waited for a few seconds,  Yandar and I looking at each other in silence."

    yandar "Oh, just one last thing..."
    #41.

    #42. 
    player_narration "Yandar didn't seem even the slightest bit fazed by what he saw on my face. In fact, he was grinning as he reached beneath the counter between us and brought up a paper bag."

    "One-hundred and twenty-one years ago, on this day, I was born. [PLAYER NAME]: [son / daughter] to Alarad and Laurin, and [brother / sister] to Olin."

    "As with the majority of lyris, on the day of my birth a tree was planted, one which would grow alongside me as the years, decades and centuries passed."

    "The tree was more than a symbolic gesture, its life was inherently bound to mine – on the day I died, so would the tree."

    "But death was the last thing on my mind as I sat in the sacred grove where my birth tree stood, for both it and I were young and strong and in the prime of our lives."

    "My eyes were closed as I meditated before my birth tree, my sight not needed to smell its familiar scent or hear the gentle rustling of its leaves as the breeze caressed its branches."

    "I felt the warmth of the sun on my face. I listened to the steady susurration of the grass around me and the pleasant singing of nearby birds."

    "I took in a deep breath of crisp morning air and then exhaled slowly. I'd visited this spot regularly since I was a child and it never failed in making me feel content and at peace."

    "But today was bittersweet. Because today, one-hundred and twenty-one years after the day I was born, was the day I came of age."

    "And the coming-of-age tradition upheld by many lyris families encouraged me to leave home and strike out on my own so that I might find my own path and experience what the world outside had to offer, both good and ill."

    "Although I had of course ventured out into other parts of Lyriathis, I'd never done so alone for any real length of time, and there were still countless places and things I had yet to see."

    "But I was torn, as although the thought of striding out into the big, wide world was a thrilling one, I was simultaneously reluctant to leave the comfort of my home and the family I loved."

    "Part of me wanted today to last forever, for me to remain here in the place where I had grown up, while another part was keen to get out there and see what life might have in store for me."

    "The sound of a fallen twig snapping somewhere behind me brought an abrupt end to my thoughts. My eyes quickly opened and I instinctively rose to my feet and turned in the direction of the sound."

    show MC happy at left
    show Olin happy at right

    "The sight of my older brother brought a smile to my face. The last time I'd seen him, Olin had promised to return home for today. I was glad to see he kept that promise."
    #15. 
    player "Military life at Fort Sol-Nahr still hasn't improved your stealth, I see."
    #16. 
    olin "I'm a captain now, I don't need to be stealthy – it's all about shouting orders at the lyris under my command."
    #17. 
    olin "And it's not as if I can order you around after today, is it, little [brother / sister]."

    #● PC and Olin walk towards each other and embrace briefly. Then they each step back and stand facing each other as they talk.
    #18. 
    player_narration "Olin and I embraced briefly. Then we each took a step back and he regarded me with a wistful smile."
    #19. 
    olin "I can't believe it's your coming-of-age already. I don't know where the years have gone."
    #20. 
    player "That's because you're losing your wits, old man."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Olin gave me a playful punch on one shoulder, both of us smiling."
    #22. 
    olin "I'm not that much older than you, smart-arse, and I'm still more than capable of kicking your backside all over this grove, so watch it."
    #23. 
    player "Thanks for making it. I know the fort keeps you busy."
    #24. 
    olin "No problem. I wouldn't have missed your big day."
    #25. 
    player "Have you seen mum and dad?"
    #26. 
    olin "Yes, the house was my first stop, they told me you were out here. Are you ready to head back?"
    #27. 
    player_narration "I took in another deep breath of the invigorating air and glanced back in the direction of my birth tree. Whatever was to come, I wished it continued strength and vitality."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I turned back to Olin. Smiling, I nodded."
    #29. 
    player "I'm ready."
    #30. 
    olin "Then let's get back before dad eats all of the pie."

    #● Walking side-by-side, Olin and PC leave the grove together, heading in the direction of their parents' house.

















    PART B

    #Location: Player-Character's family home, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We skip ahead an hour or so and cut to inside the home of Alarad and Laurin, parents of PC and Olin. Specifically, we are in the living room, which is illuminated by the sunlight that enters through the windows. The room contains a fireplace, a couple of bookcases, a few paintings hanging on the walls, and a couple of doors connecting to other parts of the house. There is also a dining table with four chairs standing around it, and sitting in the chairs are PC, Olin, Alarad and Laurin. There is food and drink on the table before them, the family having just eaten together.
    #1. 
    player_narration "My mother had piled up the dining table with an assortment of foods by the time Olin and I returned to the house, and the whole family sat down together to celebrate my coming-of-age and Olin's visit."
    #2. 
    player_narration "As we ate and drank, Olin filled us in on recent events at the fort and his life in general. I knew our parents still worried about the dangers inherent in his career of choice..."
    #3. 
    player_narration "...but he'd been a soldier – and by all accounts, a good one – for long enough now that they trusted him to look after himself."
    #4. 
    player_narration "In return, our mother told Olin about her latest alchemical experiments and findings, and our father did the same regarding his healing, both of them still as interested in their respective passions as they always had been."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Eventually we all sat back in our chairs, Olin and I stuffed to bursting and protesting our mother's insistence that we could manage a few more mouthfuls."
    #6. 
    player_narration "As I expected it to at some point, conversation began to focus on the subject of my coming-of-age. My parents shared a few choice memories of my childhood, some amusing, some embarrassing, some both."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Then my father reached beneath the dining table and brought up two wooden boxes that I didn't realise he'd had down there. He placed the boxes before him and looked at me, smiling."

    #● Alarad reaches beneath the dining table and brings up two fairly small wooden boxes which he places before him on the surface of the table. As we will see, one of these boxes contains Alarad's magical map while the other box contains Laurin's healing potion.
    #8. 
    alarad "If you can summon the willpower to move your arms after stuffing all that food, your mother and I have some gifts we'd like to give you."
    #9. 
    player "Thank you. Should I open them now?"
    #10. 
    olin "If you don't, I will."

    #● PC reaches over and pulls the two boxes towards him. He opens the first box and takes out the item within: a sealed glass bottle filled with a coloured liquid.
    #11. 
    player_narration "I opened the first box and carefully removed the item within after unfolding the small sheet of cloth in which it was wrapped."
    #12. 
    player_narration "It was a bottle, its glass finely crafted but sturdy. Contained within was some kind of liquid. Assuming this was one of my mother's concoctions, I looked at her."
    #13. 
    player "What is it?"
    #14. 
    laurin "A healing potion. It's very potent. The recipe is one I've studied and tinkered with over the years, and as today got closer, I finally decided to commit to my own take on the formula and cook it up."
    #15. 
    laurin "It's the only one I'm likely to make for a long time, if not ever – I've only ever owned one vial of dragon blood and I used it in that potion."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Of course I believed my mother but even so, I couldn't help but raise my eyebrows in surprise. Olin chuckled."
    #17. 
    olin "Mum, dragons have been extinct for... well, forever. How would you have some of their blood just lying around?"
    #18. 
    laurin "Blood can last a very long time if it's properly preserved. It was passed down to me by my mother. She never told me where she got it from."
    #19. 
    olin "So why didn't you make this one-of-a-kind healing potion for me when I came of age?"
    #20. 
    laurin "I wasn't as experienced then as I am now. I didn't trust my skills enough to use the dragon blood in a worthy manner and I certainly wasn't going to waste it. So I waited. And now I'm good enough."
    #21. 
    player "If you ask me nicely, Olin, maybe I'll let you have a drop next time you stub your toe."
    #22. 
    olin "You're the one who's going to need it when I stub my boot on your thick head."
    #23. 
    player "Thanks, mum. This is amazing."
    #24. 
    laurin "You're welcome. Open your other present."

    #● PC places the healing potion back inside its box. Then he takes hold of the second box, opens it, and takes out the item that was contained within: a cloth map.
    #25. 
    player_narration "I placed the healing potion back inside its box before taking hold of the second box. I opened it and removed the item it contained: a cloth map."
    #26. 
    player_narration "The map was detailed, its lines drawn cleanly and carefully. It covered not only all of Lyriathis but also the neighbouring lands of Dahraith and Grana as well."
    #27. 
    player_narration "My eyes roamed over the map for a few seconds before they focused on something I suddenly noticed: a very small and faint dot of light emanating from a particular spot on the map."
    #28. 
    player_narration "In fact, the location marked by the dot seemed to be where our house stood in reality. I looked at my father."
    #29. 
    player "An enchanted map."
    #30. 
    alarad "I drew it, but I had to ask for help from a mage I know to actually enchant it."
    #31. 
    player "It looks great. I assume the light marks the house?"
    #32. 
    alarad "Not quite. It's you."
    #33. 
    alarad "The enchantment is tied to your physical presence, so wherever you go in the lands covered by that map, the light will follow you and mark your current location. That way, the map will always show you where you are – you'll never be lost."
    #34. 
    olin "So did you get a second copy made for you and mum, so you can always keep track of [PLAYER NAME]?"
    #35. 
    alarad "I'd be lying if I said the thought didn't cross my mind, but no. [He's / She's] of age now, we shouldn't be watching over [him / her] all of the time."
    #36. 
    player "Thanks, dad. I really appreciate this."
    #37. 
    alarad "If you do go travelling, it can help remind you where home is, and that mum and I are always here."
    #38. 
    player "I'd never forget that."

    #● PC places the map back within its box.
    #39. 
    laurin "Olin, are you going to give your [brother / sister] your gift?"
    #40. 
    olin "Well, I can't compete with dragon blood or a magic map, but anyway..."

    #"Olin reaches beneath the table and brings up a small item wrapped in cloth. As we will see in a moment, the concealed item is a dagger. Olin places the item before PC."
    #41. 
    olin "...here you go."
    #42. 
    player_narration "Olin reached beneath the table and brought up an item which he placed before me. I couldn't tell what it was as it was wrapped in cloth."
    #43. 
    player_narration "I picked up the bundle and unwrapped it to reveal what was inside: a dagger."

    #"PC opens the cloth bundle and takes out the dagger from within. Carefully holding it in both hands, he inspects it."
    #44. 
    player_narration "The blade was sharp, and polished to the degree that I could see my face reflected back at me in the flat of the blade. The handle was metal and covered in an elegant and elaborate pattern."
    #45. 
    player_narration "Whoever had made the dagger had clearly put a lot of care and effort into it. It was a good weight and felt comfortable in my hand. I looked at my brother."
    #46. 
    player "Thank you. I'm no expert but it looks like a fine piece of work."
    #47. 
    olin "I've seen a lot of daggers and believe me, it is."
    #48. 
    player_narration "Out of the corner of my eye I saw my mother shift in her seat, and although she was still smiling, it seemed a little strained now. I assumed she wasn't overly keen on the idea of me receiving a weapon as a gift."
    #49. 
    player_narration "Olin noticed her reaction as well – his eyes flicked briefly in her direction before focusing on me again."
    #50. 
    olin "I received that dagger years ago, during one of my earliest missions at Fort Sol-Nahr. A group of eight soldiers, including myself, rescued some travellers from a gang of bandits who'd been operating in the woods."
    #51. 
    olin "One of the travellers was an old lyrian – an old soldier. During our fight with the bandits, I saved his daughter's life. He gave me that dagger in return."
    #52. 
    olin "Apparently he'd had it for centuries. He said he was once a member of an elite group of rangers and that each member received an identical dagger upon joining, as a symbol of their status. That dagger was the one given to him."
    #53. 
    olin "The group disbanded centuries ago and the old lyrian was convinced he wasn't long for this world, so he thought it would be fitting to pass down the dagger to a fellow soldier."
    #54. 
    olin "With what I'd done for his daughter, he decided that I was that soldier. He wouldn't take "no"for an answer."
    #55. 
    olin "Anyway, it's mine to pass down now, and while you may not be a soldier, [PLAYER NAME], you're worthy of it and I know you'll take good care of it."
    #56. 
    olin "The old lyrian's daughter also rewarded me with a kiss but I think I'll hang onto that. She was quite the pretty thing."
    #57. 
    player_narration "Olin grinned while our father chuckled and our mother rolled her eyes."
    #58. 
    player "Thanks, Olin. I will take care of it."

    #"PC places the dagger back within its bundle and rewraps it, leaving it on the table before him."
    #59. 
    player_narration "I rewrapped the dagger and placed it next to my other two gifts. Then Olin asked the question I'd been waiting to hear from someone."
    #60. 
    olin "So, have you decided what you're going to do now that you've come of age? Are you going to venture out on your own and explore the world or stay here and annoy mum and dad?"
    #61. 
    player_narration "I'd already given a lot of thought to my future, but before I could give Olin any kind of answer, our mother spoke."
    #62. 
    laurin "Olin, give your [brother / sister] a chance, [his / her] coming-of-age day isn't even halfway-over yet. There's plenty of time for all that."
    #63. 
    laurin "Now, who wants pudding?"
    #64. 
    player_narration "My father both frowned and smiled as he placed one hand on his stomach."
    #65. 
    alarad "Not for me, sweetheart, or I'll never be able to get up from this chair. Why don't you fatten up your children some more while they're both here?"
    #66. 
    olin "At this rate you'll have to cart me back to the fort in a wheelbarrow. But since I'll be back on military food soon enough, I suppose I should make the most of it while I'm here."
    #67. 
    laurin "That's my boy. What about you, [PLAYER NAME]?"
    #68. 
    player "Sounds good. Like you said, there's no rush."
    #69. 
    player_narration "While that was true to a degree, I was old enough now to understand that delaying the future was impossible – it was coming for me in some form, whether I was ready or not."
    #70. 
    player_narration "But first, pudding. "

We are in a large, open field and this is where the Grana Autumn Fair is currently taking place, the events, activities and decorations having been set up in the field. The activities and stalls include various food tables, a sheep-lifting contest, a dance-floor with a group of musicians playing nearby, a wrestling arena, a cup-and-ball stall, and an archery contest where three circular targets stand. The fair is crowded with humans, both men and women, although there are also a handful of lyrians and lyria mixed in amongst them. Two of these are Tirael and Player-Character (PC), who stand together amongst the crowds.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The Grana Autumn Fair had been an annual human event for decades, and the sun was shining and the stalls and activities bustling as Tirael and I explored this year's fair."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Tirael had been right that it was quite different to lyris celebrations, being more down-to-earth and boisterous..."
    #3. 
    player_narration "...but the fundamental aim – a continuation of tradition designed to bring people together and entertain them – was the same, and I couldn't help but smile."
    #4. 
    player_narration "It was good to see Tirael seemingly enjoying himself as well, it had been a long time since I'd seen him appear even remotely carefree."
    #5. 
    tirael "Right, then. We've watched grown men grappling each other into submission in the wrestling arena and stuffed our faces with more strange human dishes than could possibly be good for us..."
    #6. 
    tirael "...so what's next?"
    #7. 
    player_narration "I looked around and two particular activities caught my eye."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Firstly there was the archery contest, where the goal was to hit the bullseye on three separate targets within a strict time limit."
    #9. 
    player_narration "And then there was the rather more unusual – to a lyris, anyway – contest of sheep-lifting."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Here the challenge was to lift above your head a long pole with two overweight sheep harnessed to it, one at each end. It was an ostensibly amusing but deceptively difficult contest – they were very fat sheep."

    tirael "Welcome to the fort. More hands are always needed these days, apparently, as long as they can serve a purpose."

    tirael "Very admirable. But do yourself a favour and don't go telling that to everyone around here or you'll be taking over all their undesirable jobs before you know it."    #9.3.

    Tirael and my brother eyed me with amusement as I looked doubtfully at the cup of dark liquid in my hand, the aroma of which stung my eyes. I was fairly sure that wasn't a good sign.
    #2. 
    Nonetheless, I lifted the cup and took a long swallow. After taking a moment to lull me into a false sense of security, the alcohol then hit my throat and chest like a flaming cannonball.

    tirael "This stuff will put hairs on your eyeballs, Olin."
    #6. 
    olin "True, Arthar's homemade brew has a certain... rambunctiousness to it... but we have to make do with what we can get out here, don't we."
    #7. 
    olin "You know we can't get decent wine nor ale at this damn fort for love nor money. Not even with your high-and-mighty connections, o noble Tirael."
    #8. 
    tirael "I've told you not to overestimate my links to the capital. They're somewhat strained nowadays."
    #9. 
    tirael "A request for drink to be sent – or decent food, for that matter – would be met with the same response as if I requested a horse made of diamond: polite condescension and refusal."
    #10. 
    tirael "Not that I'd waste my time sending a message in the first place."
    #11. 
    player "What's – * koff * – in it?"
    #12. 
    olin "Some questions are best left unanswered. Arthar's not saying, and I have a feeling if we did know, we'd sooner be using it to poison our enemies than drink it ourselves."
    #13. 
    olin "The simple fact is, it's the closest thing we've got to wine or ale and we're celebrating. I'll top up your cup."

    #● Uh, actually, I'm fine. (GO TO 15.1.)

    Olin poured from the jug once again, refilling my cup with Arthar's mysterious brew.
    #17. 
    Although I felt as if I'd swallowed a bear, I knew Olin had gone to some trouble to get his hands on the alcohol, so again I drank deeply.

    olin "Our father and I found [him / her] wandering naked around the orchard, blind-drunk and singing "The Holiest of Elves Was She"."
    #22. 
    olin "I laughed so hard I could barely breathe. Our father wasn't quite as amused."
    #23. 
    player "Thank you for sharing that story with yet another person, Olin. Always appreciated."

    tirael "Consider yourself lucky that your family shares such memories, [PLAYER NAME]. My family certainly doesn't."

    #● Well, I'd appreciate it if you didn't share it with anyone else. (GO TO 26.2.)
    #● The poor, poor life of a young, rich noble. My heart bleeds for you. (GO TO 26.3.)
    #26.1.
    tirael "Frankly, I am. Growing up with the wealth and privileges of nobility isn't without its advantages, of course, but the life itself is stiff and cold more than anything else."    #26.2.
    tirael "Oh, but it's such a charming tale. Worthy of song, even. But very well, my lips are sealed."    #26.3.
    tirael "I see the drink hasn't impaired your cutting sarcasm. Mocking something you little understand is not an attractive trait, soldier."
    #27. 
    olin "Sorry it's taken so long to give you a proper welcome, [PLAYER NAME]. I would've done this sooner if Commander Hael didn't have us all so busy preparing for a war that's never going to come."
    #28. 
    olin "This is the first night I've had free in a long while, and of course, when I asked your captain to make sure you were free as well, that arrogant noble insisted on coming along himself."
    #29. 
    tirael "I may be an estranged noble, but I still light up any social occasion, captain."
    #30. 
    olin "And we're eternally grateful to you for gracing us with your presence, captain."
    #31. 
    player "So Commander Hael still thinks this war is going to happen?"
    #32. 
    olin "He's like a dog with a bone. I reminded him how there have been rumours and whispers like these more than once over the years, and they've always amounted to nothing."
    #33. 
    olin "But he says something's different this time. I've asked him what, but he never answers."
    #34. 
    olin "And he's not the only one on edge, if what he says about the goings-on in the capital are true."
    #35. 
    olin "Don't get me wrong, I respect Commander Hael as much as the next soldier, but personally...? I don't think there's anything to be concerned about. This will all blow over soon enough."
    #36. 
    tirael "Something we wholeheartedly agree upon. There's a rarity."
    #37. 
    olin "And since there's nothing to be concerned about, I think another drink is in order. Here, [PLAYER NAME], pass me your cup."
    #38. 
    Olin refilled my drink. This time the liquid didn't seem to taste as bad, and before I knew it, I had drained my cup in just a few gulps.
    #39. 
    No unpleasant after-effects this time. Actually, apart from a strange tingling behind my eyes, I couldn't feel a bloody thing.
    #40. 
    player "Mm, you were right about this stuff. Much smoother now."
    #41. 
    olin "...Really? Because your eyes are looking in two different directions and your right arm is twitching. Uh, I think perhaps you've had enough."
    #42. 
    player "Rubbish! Another cupful! Like you said, we're celebra–"
    #43. 
    And that's the last thing I remember. Olin said I passed out right there at the table, my forehead hitting the rim of my cup hard enough to leave a circular dent in my skin for several hours.
    #44. 
    I woke up the next morning in my bunk, feeling like I'd been trampled by a team of horses.
    #45. 
    Still, I was sure that my brother and my captain had been deeply concerned with my welfare and had looked after me with the utmost care and urgency.
    #46. 
    ...That's what they told me later, anyway.
    #47. 
    TIREAL: ...I think Arthar's killed your [brother / sister].

    olin "[He's / She's] drunk, not dead."

    olin "...I think."

    #53. 
    olin "* sigh * ...Alright, help me get this idiot up onto my shoulders."

A squad comprised of PC (Player-Character), Tirael, and six other soldiers from the fort have made camp for the night in the clearing, the camp illuminated by a fire. The soldiers all sit around the fire as PC cooks a large bowl of stew over it.

    #Location: Inside the Forest Fort (Day)
    #● Somewhere within the forest fort, Tirael and PC (Player-Character) are discussing Hador, who has become a prisoner at the fort since the previous episode.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Our prisoner was a black tiger no longer, the shape-shifter having reverted to his true dahris form soon after we brought him to the fort."
    #2. 
    player_narration "But although he seemed to have regained his senses, he hadn't regained his tongue. Despite repeated questioning, he hadn't spoken a word."
    #3. 
    player_narration "He simply sat in his cell, staring ahead or sleeping, and barely partaking of the food and water offered to him."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Those soldiers who took the shape-shifter's appearance in the woods as proof of a dahris conspiracy – or even invasion – urged the need to loosen his lips by whatever means necessary..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...but Commander Hael wouldn't hear of torture, despite his own concerns and the fact that no words or magic had revealed anything of the shape-shifter's identity or intentions."
    #6. 
    player_narration "So tomorrow, a platoon of soldiers would be escorting our silent prisoner to the capital, where Hael's superiors would decide how to deal with him."
    #7. 
    player_narration "In the meantime, all we at the fort could do was wait and speculate."
    #8. 
    tirael "Whether they're planning to go to war or not, the shape-shifter's a dahris spy, simple as that. I don't see what all the arguing is about."
    #9. 
    player "What makes you so sure, sir?"
    #10. 
    tirael "Oh, just a little thing called "all available evidence"."
    #11. 
    tirael "Firstly, he's a dahris a long way from home, sneaking about our woods disguised as an animal."
    #12. 
    tirael "Secondly, if he was innocent, why not profess it after he reverted to his dahris form? But no, he hasn't said a word."
    #13. 
    tirael "And finally, he's of noble blood. I've spent most of my life around those of "high birth", I can see it in how he carries himself."
    #14. 
    tirael "And what we know of the dahris nobility suggests that very few of them are pampered, weak-willed politicians like many of ours are."
    #15. 
    tirael "It wouldn't be amiss for them to entrust a spying mission to a capable noble, especially one who could change shape at will. A useful trick for a spy, that."
    #16. 
    player "But then why a black tiger? Why choose a creature so rare and foreign, one which would easily draw attention?"
    #17. 
    tirael "Well, I didn't say he was a very good spy, now did I."
    #18. 
    tirael "Why? Do you think I'm wrong about him?"
    #19.1.
    PLAYER:
    #● No, you're probably right. (GO TO 19.2.)
    #● When we found him, he seemed to have lost himself by spending too much time in his animal form – what if this is all just because of that? (GO TO 20.2.)
    #● I don't know, sir. (GO TO 19.3.)
    #19.2.
    player "As you said, he's had plenty of time to explain himself. "#(GO TO 20.1.)
    #19.3.
    player "With so many theories and opinions flying around, it's hard to know what to think. "#(GO TO 20.3.)
    #20.1.
    tirael "Exactly. Let the capital deal with him. I have little patience for intrigues and politics. There's a reason I left all that behind me. "#(GO TO 21.)    #20.2.
    tirael "So he was playing at being a tiger in his own country, got carried away, and then simply wandered across the border and deep into our own land? And the experience has since struck him mute? I don't think so, [PLAYER NAME]. "#(GO TO 21.)    #20.3.
    tirael "Yes, by now you should've learned not to put much faith in a lot of what you hear in this place. Unless it comes from me, of course. "#(GO TO 21.)
    #21. 
    tirael "Anyway, as of tomorrow morning the shape-shifter won't be our problem anymore, so let's not waste any more breath on him."
    #22. 
    tirael "Right now, the dahris declaring war on us would almost be a blessed relief, if only because it would put an end to all the rumours and arguments."
    #23. 
    tirael "Still, "be careful what you wish for"and all that, I suppose. "

    #Location: Inside the Forest Fort (Night)
    #● PC (Player-Character) has been walking around the fort at night due to being unable to sleep. They enter a quiet, open-air practice yard which is empty at this time of night except for Tirael, who was also unable to sleep and is now practicing his swordplay in the yard instead.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The moon was slowly sailing across a sea of stars when I exited the barracks, the cool night air blowing away any remaining hopes of sleep."
    #2. 
    player_narration "For the past two hours I'd been laying on my bunk and staring at the ceiling, my eyes no heavier than they had been that morning."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Eventually I decided to occupy myself by taking a walk around the fort."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Pools of orange light surrounding burning torches were dotted throughout the darkness, and for a time I walked the paths, corridors and battlements."
    #5. 
    player_narration "With no destination in mind, my feet led me to a small, walled yard near the fort's outer wall. "
    #6. 
    player_narration "I stopped and listened more closely to the sounds issuing from within: the clipped whooshing sound of a blade cutting the air, grunts of accompanying effort, and boot soles lightly scuffing the stone floor."
    #7. 
    player_narration "As I pushed open the wooden door that led into the yard, I wondered who would be training at this time of night."
    #8. 
    player_narration "At the creaking of the door, Tirael stopped his swordplay and turned to look at me. He lowered his sword to his side, its keen blade shining with light reflected from a nearby torch."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Captain Tirael was alone in the yard, which held little more than a few stacks of covered barrels and crates around its edges and was overlooked only by bare stone walls and the sky."
    #10. 
    tirael "Evening, [PLAYER NAME]. If you're coming in, close the door."
    #11. 
    player_narration "I did as Tirael said and then walked over to where he stood in the centre of the yard."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I didn't know how long he'd been practicing in here but he looked no more tired than I felt."
    #13. 
    tirael "I'm not the only one who can't sleep, then."
    #14. 
    player "No. I thought I'd go for a walk to try to clear my head."
    #15. 
    tirael "I understand. I get them from time to time: nights like these, where I have more chance of plucking the moon from the sky than getting any sleep. I couldn't tell you why."
    #16. 
    tirael "And on those nights I usually end up here. If I've got the time to spend, it seems to me I might as well spend it doing something useful."
    #17. 
    tirael "And with swordfighting, no matter how good you are, there's always room for improvement, however slight."
    #18. 
    player "Sorry for disturbing you, captain. I'll leave you to it."
    #19. 
    tirael "Nonsense."
    #20. 
    player_narration "I watched as Tirael walked over to a pair of scabbards standing against a wall. One was empty while the other held another of Tirael's swords."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Tirael picked up the full scabbard in his free hand and tossed it in my direction. I caught the weapon in both hands."
    #22. 
    tirael "I always bring two swords with me so I can practice my dual-wielding. But since you're here..."
    #23. 
    tirael "Well, let's just say that if I still have room for improvement then you certainly do. Draw your weapon."
    #24. 
    player_narration "I withdrew the gleaming sword and hefted it in one hand, admiring the fine weapon as I placed the empty scabbard on the ground."
    #25. 
    tirael "Let's see if we can tire ourselves out with some sparring, shall we?"
    #26. 
    player_narration "And so we began our dance around the yard."
    #27. 
    player_narration "It wasn't the first time Tirael and I had sparred with real steel instead of wooden practice swords, and the weapons whistled and clashed as we slashed and parried."
    #28. 
    player_narration "As ever, Tirael threw the occasional mocking remark my way in an effort to distract me but I refused to let him bait me, and so back and forth the fight continued."
    #29. 
    player_narration "Just a few minutes later and we were both breathing heavily, my arms aching with the effort of the fighting, as I knew Tirael's must be."
    #30. 
    player_narration "Our swords clashed yet again and then we stepped backwards and stood facing each other for a moment, holding each other's gaze."
    #31.

    #● We are in a ground-floor room inside the home of Tirael's family, in the lyris capital city. Because they are a noble and wealthy family, the family home is quite large, grand and expensively decorated. The room we are in is a parlour or something similar.

    #● Skip ahead to the morning after the Sky Flower Festival. We are in the inn in which PC has spent the night, specifically the ground-floor common room where guests can order food and drink.

    #Location: The lyris capital city's dungeons (Day)
    #● We are in the capital city's dungeons where criminals are held, and this is where Tirael is currently being held as he awaits his trial. His cell has a stone floor and ceiling, three stone walls and a wall of iron bars – with a door set into them – connecting the cell to the hallway that runs past it. One of the stone walls features a small barred window that lets in daylight from outside. The cell is bare except for a bed and a bucket. Tirael, dressed in simple prisoner's clothes, is sitting on the bed while PC stands before him, the two of them facing each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Although the sun was shining on a warm morning outside, the old stone interior of the capital's dungeons was cool when I visited Tirael in the cell he occupied there."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I stood before my imprisoned captain, who appeared a gaunt and haunted imitation of the lyrian I knew."
    #3. 
    tirael "I didn't kill my brother...!"
    #4. 
    player_narration "Tirael's expression was desperate as he professed his innocence but then he bowed his head and let out a long breath, running his hands back through his hair as he composed himself."
    #5. 
    player_narration "It was hard to tell whether he was trying to convince me or himself. I had a feeling it was probably both."
    #6. 
    player "I believe you, captain."
    #7. 
    tirael "Others will call you a fool for doing so. I know what they're saying. I know how the situation looks, even to my own family."

    #13. 
    tirael "[PLAYER NAME], I appreciate you coming to see me but you shouldn't get more involved in this than you already are."
    #14. 
    player "With all due respect, captain, if you think I'm going to abandon you then your imprisonment must have already rotted your brain."
    #15. 
    player "What happened between you and Callis?"
    #16. 
    tirael "...During the festival, I lost Laerise. She went to speak to some friends while I bought us a couple of drinks."
    #17. 
    tirael "When I went to find her, she wasn't where she said she'd be. I searched for over an hour but she was nowhere to be seen."
    #18. 
    tirael "In the end, angry and a little drunk, I gave up and returned to my father's house, alone."
    #19. 
    tirael "I'd been drinking in the study for a while when Callis came home. Lyssael and our father were still out. By now, my brother and I were both very drunk."
    #20. 
    tirael "The drink made Callis more obnoxious than usual. He couldn't resist taunting me about losing Laerise, saying that she'd probably discarded me for wealthier game."
    #21. 
    tirael "We argued. As we always end up doing. Eventually, verbal sparring was no longer enough."
    #22. 
    tirael "I can't remember whose idea it was but we decided to settle our argument with some fencing, right there and then."
    #23. 
    tirael "I already had one of my swords with me in the study while Callis took one from the wall. We fought. We were both slow and sloppy from the drink but even so, I've always been a better swordsman than Callis."
    #24. 
    tirael "I parried one of his strikes and I was... I remember being so angry that I gave him a cut across the chest – not a deep one, but enough to draw blood."
    #25. 
    tirael "Callis stumbled and fell over an armchair. When he saw he was bleeding, I think he was surprised at what I'd done, even with how bitterly we'd been arguing."
    #26. 
    tirael "I – I didn't really mean to hurt him, he just... he made me so angry..."
    #27. 
    player "So what happened then?"
    #28. 
    tirael "I was drunk, [PLAYER NAME]. I admit that. But I'm sure Callis wasn't that badly hurt."
    #29. 
    tirael "Callis, he – he asked me to fetch a healing potion from his room. He always had more time for sorcery and alchemy than I did."
    #30. 
    tirael "I went upstairs to his room. I was drunk and I wasn't familiar with the room so it took me some time to find the potion he wanted, but in the end I did."
    #31. 
    tirael "Then I headed back downstairs and into the study."
    #32. 
    player_narration "Tirael lapsed into silence for a moment, staring down at the floor between his feet with a troubled frown. "
    #33. 
    tirael "I went in and... Callis was dead."
    #34. 
    tirael "I tried to help him. I used the healing potion, I tried to get his heart beating again but... nothing worked."
    #35. 
    tirael "It didn't make any sense! The cut I gave him was nowhere near enough to kill him, I'm sure of it! It wasn't even a serious wound, let alone a fatal one...!"
    #36. 
    tirael "...But there he was. Lying in a pool of blood with a hole in his chest. Dead."
    #37. 
    tirael "It doesn't make any sense but I – I can't remember...!"
    #38. 
    tirael "As I was trying to help Callis, I heard a scream from the doorway behind me. I turned to see Lyssael standing there. Kiaris had just walked her home and then left."

    #39.2.

    #39.3.
    player_narration "Kiaris was an arrogant and spoilt noble and he and Tirael had hated each other for years. Tirael learned of the engagement soon after we arrived in the capital. He hadn't taken the news well. "#(GO TO 40.)

    #40. 
    tirael "You can imagine how the situation must have looked to my sister. The look on her face... that's something I do remember clearly. And I wish I didn't."

    #● Illinea appears in the hallway and walks up to Tirael's cell. She talks to PC through the bars.
    #41.

    #45. 
    player_narration "I said nothing more. Instead I simply gave Tirael a nod and exited the cell."
    #46. 
    player_narration "As I walked along the stone hallway, heading for the exit of the dungeons, I heard Illinea close and lock Tirael's cell door behind me. "
    #47. 
    player_narration "I thought about everything Tirael had told me. I had told him I believed him, and I didn't want that to change."
    #48. 
    player_narration "But with the facts being what they were and with Tirael's memory of that night being what it was, I couldn't ignore the fact that my captain's situation appeared a bleak one. "

    #Location: High Council Chambers, Lyr-Taer (Day)
    #● We are inside the capital city's High Council Chambers, where Tirael's trial is about to begin. The room is large and grand, with tall windows letting in daylight from outside. Tirael stands flanked by two guards while sitting opposite him, across the room, is the lyris ruler, Tialas. At Tialas' sides sit the members of his High Council: the Archmage Dahenwar; Tirael's father, Ashel; Commander Hael; and several other wealthy, powerful lyrians. Illinea stands between Tirael and the lyrians sitting opposite him. Several pews stand off to one side of the room and sitting on these are various citizens including the Player-Character and Kiaris, who sit apart from each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The day of Tirael's trial arrived and I still wasn't aware of any proof that definitively answered the question of his guilt one way or the other."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Things looked just as bleak for Tirael as they had when I'd visited him in the dungeons, but I was determined to attend the trial even if all I could offer was moral support."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Our country's ruler, Tialas, sat in judgement of Tirael, and with him were his High Council, which was made up of a number of the kingdom's most powerful lyrians."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Kiaris' father, the Archmage Dahenwar, occupied a seat on the council, but worst of all for Tirael was that his father, Ashel, as the kingdom's Councillor of Finance, did the same."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Anyone who thought that having a father on the High Council would be an advantage for the accused clearly didn't know Ashel or his relationship with his surviving son."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Ashel's face was stone as he stared at his son. Tirael's father would be of no help to him."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Flanked by two guards, Tirael appeared tired but defiant as he stood and stared back at his father and the other powerful lyrians who would decide his fate."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Next to Ashel sat Commander Hael, who had recently come from the Forest Fort to carry out his duty as a member of the High Council."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Hael appeared uncomfortable, clearly taking no pleasure in his role as one of those judging Tirael."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Although Hael liked him well enough and trusted him as a soldier, in the end Hael would judge him on the facts, nothing more. And the facts looked grim for Tirael."
    #11. 
    player_narration "In the public gallery where I sat, other interested citizens had come to watch the proceedings. "
    #12. 
    player_narration "Noticeable by their absence were both Lyssael and Laerise, although Kiaris was there, looking on with a relaxed and confident expression."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Tialas called for silence and a hush descended upon the High Council Chambers."
    #14. 
    tialas "We have convened in our kingdom's High Council Chambers today in order to determine the guilt or innocence of Tirael, son of Ashel – "
    #15. 
    tialas "– in regards to the crime of which he stands accused: the murder of his brother, Callis."
    #16. 
    tialas "Captain Illinea, please begin your presentation of the facts to the court."
    #17. 
    illinea "Yes, sir."
    #18. 
    player_narration "All eyes were on Illinea as she began to address the court. There was no malice in her voice, no judgement of Tirael – she was just doing her job."
    #19. 
    illinea "In the early hours of the morning following the Sky Flower Festival, three city guards, including myself, were approached by a servant from the Ashel family home."
    #20. 
    illinea "She told us there had been an incident at the house and our presence was required."
    #21. 
    illinea "When we arrived, Councillor of Finance Ashel was present, as was his daughter, Lady Lyssael, although she was asleep upstairs."
    #22. 
    illinea "Lyssael had been given a sleeping potion by her father as she had been in great distress over what had occurred at the house."
    #23. 
    illinea "My colleagues and I were shown into the ground-floor study, where we found the body of Callis. Upon inspection, he appeared to have died from a stab wound to the chest."
    #24. 
    illinea "Tirael sat nearby, extremely inebriated. He informed us that he and his brother had argued and then fought with swords."
    #25. 
    illinea "Tirael claimed he had wounded Callis and then gone to fetch a healing potion from his brother's bedroom, but that when he returned to the study, Callis was dead."
    #26. 
    illinea "Via his sorcery, Archmage Dahenwar is able to show us a small portion of the events that transpired in Ashel's study that night."
    #27. 
    illinea "Archmage, if you would...?"
    #28. 
    player_narration "The Archmage rose from his seat amongst the High Council and walked towards the centre of the room, his expression and manner cool and dispassionate."
    #29. 
    player_narration "Illinea stepped back as Dahenwar came to a stop and stood with his head bowed and his eyes closed as he concentrated."
    #30. 
    player_narration "He held his hands up before his chest and his fingers began to make shifting gestures in the air, his movements steady and graceful as he worked his magic."
    #31. 
    player_narration "As Dahenwar's fingers danced, magical light began to emanate from them, and after a few seconds of this, swirls and spots of the same light began to appear several feet above his head."
    #32. 
    player_narration "These swirls and spots of light coalesced until they eventually formed a two-dimensional, semi-transparent scene."
    #33. 
    player_narration "The image was slightly strange in colour and distorted, but clear enough that I recognised the location being shown as the study in Tirael's family home."
    #34. 
    player_narration "The Archmage's hands stopped moving as he held them in a particular position before his chest. The piece of history magically recreated above him began to play out, although it did so in silence."
    #35. 
    player_narration "We were seeing the study on the night of the Sky Flower Festival, the swordfight between Tirael and Callis already underway."
    #36. 
    player_narration "The two brothers lunged and parried, their movements often clumsy and unsteady due to their drunken condition."
    #37. 
    player_narration "Neither seemed particularly intent on delivering a killing blow, although at times this restraint seemed fragile and poised to shatter, such was the brothers' obvious anger towards each other."
    #38. 
    player_narration "Eventually, Tirael landed a hit on Callis' chest, drawing blood, although the particular angle at which we were viewing the scene didn't allow for a clear look at the severity of the wound."
    #39. 
    player_narration "Apparently surprised, Callis stumbled backwards and fell over an armchair, collapsing to the floor. Once again our viewing angle obscured enough of Callis that his condition couldn't be ascertained."
    #40. 
    player_narration "Everyone in the High Council Chambers watched as Tirael stepped forward and stood over his brother, victorious, his sword held down at his side. Tirael had his back to us, so we couldn't see his face."
    #41. 
    player_narration "Although those of us watching couldn't see if Callis was alive or dead, I knew this looked bad for Tirael and that as far as most people here were concerned, they had just witnessed a killing blow."
    #42. 
    player_narration "Tirael stood over his brother until eventually he turned and walked away, moving off one side of the image and out of sight."
    #43. 
    player_narration "Although the scene continued to play out in the air above Dahenwar, for several minutes nothing happened, our obscured view of Callis remaining the same as he lay unmoving."
    #44. 
    player_narration "Then, finally, Tirael came back into view, now holding a glass vial of liquid in one hand – the healing potion he had gone to fetch for Callis."
    #45. 
    player_narration "Tirael walked over to Callis and once again stood over his brother, looking down at him. His lips moved as he said his brother's name. Once. Twice. But Callis didn't move."
    #46. 
    player_narration "An expression of concern and fear began to dawn on Tirael's face but before we could see any more of it, he turned and lowered himself onto one knee, next to Callis."
    #47. 
    player_narration "Tirael grasped his brother, shaking his shoulders, gently at first but then more firmly, his movements becoming more urgent."
    #48. 
    player_narration "Still holding Callis, his brother's blood now on his hands, Tirael's head suddenly snapped towards the study entrance. I assumed this was at the sound of Lyssael's scream upon her discovery of her brothers."
    #49. 
    player_narration "Then the magical vision began to flicker and fade. Dahenwar lowered his hands and several seconds later, the image disappeared entirely."
    #50. 
    player_narration "Dahenwar, his expression as impassive as ever, made his way back to his seat. Around me, people shifted in their seats or murmured to one another in hushed tones. They had seen enough."
    #51. 
    player_narration "I looked over at Tirael to find him staring down at the floor with a troubled frown. As for myself, I felt a nagging itch at the back of my mind, like something wasn't quite right."

    #53.2.
    player_narration "In the vision, during the time when Tirael had been out of sight, there had been an... aberration in the magic. "#(GO TO 53.3.)
    #53.3.
    player_narration "A flicker so brief and miniscule that only the eye of an extremely skilled and knowledgeable sorcerer would have been able to spot it. And I had come to possess such an eye. "#(GO TO 53.4.)
    #53.4.
    player_narration "Not only that but I recognised what that aberration meant: Dahenwar had manipulated the vision shown in his spell in an effort to hide something from those watching. "#(GO TO 53.5.)

    #Location: A wooded area near the Lyriathis / Grana border (Night)
    #● Player-Character (PC) and Olin stand talking in the forest at night, just a few miles from the border between Lyriathis and Grana.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I'd almost reached the border between Lyriathis and Grana when Olin caught up to me."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd passed through the Forest Fort the day before but only briefly, and both my brother and Commander Hael had been elsewhere so I hadn't seen either of them."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Apparently they returned to the fort not long after I'd left, and upon hearing of my recent presence, Hael immediately sent Olin to track me down. He'd been following me through the woods since then."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I was on my way to Grana as I knew that the Lyriathis / Grana border was where Tirael had been taken after his trial, so I assumed that Grana was where I would find him."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I needed to tell my captain about the suspicions which had formed in my head at his trial, and now that he was a free lyrian – beyond our kingdom's borders, at least – I had the chance to do so."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I needed to let Tirael know that it might not be too late to clear his name, and I told Olin this after he had caught up to me in the forest."
    #7. 
    olin "You sound certain of Tirael's innocence. That's good. Because I don't think he's guilty either."
    #8. 
    olin "Tirael's one of the finest swordsmen I've ever seen: he's fast, precise..."
    #9. 
    olin "He wouldn't have accidentally killed his brother in a swordfight, I don't care how drunk he was. Tirael would only have killed him if he intended to – and I don't think for a second he intended to kill his own brother."
    #10. 
    player "There are secrets and lies swirling around Callis' death and I plan on discovering what they are."
    #11. 
    player "I need to find Tirael to tell him not to wander too far from Lyriathis, to stay close and give me time to clear his name."
    #12. 
    player "If I can do so then his conviction can be overturned and he can return home."
    #13. 
    olin "Giving the noble, ruling elite a black eye in the process? Tirael's influence must have rubbed off on you. He'd be proud."

    #15. 
    player "How was he?"
    #16. 
    olin "As good as can be expected. When I asked him where he'd go, he said he was going to head to Belgran to try to find some work."
    #17. 
    olin "He had nothing but the clothes on his back, so I snuck him a dagger and a few coins, just something to help keep him safe in his travels and so he could get a roof over his head when he reached the granian capital."
    #18. 
    olin "I told him if he ever needed anything, to get word to me at the fort and I'd help how I could."
    #19. 
    olin "But listen, [PLAYER NAME], there's something I need to tell you. It's the reason Hael sent me after you."
    #20. 
    player "What is it?"
    #21. 
    olin "With Tirael exiled, we're down one captain at the fort. Hael wants to promote you to the rank of captain and give you Tirael's former position."
    #22. 
    olin "You're to return with me. Immediately."
    #23. 
    player_narration "I didn't blame Hael for his condemnation of Tirael at the trial, and the Commander was a fine and fair leader, so part of me was flattered at his desire to promote me."
    #24. 
    player_narration "But the rest of me cursed Hael for his timing and for offering me a position which, as far as I was concerned, still belonged to Tirael."
    #25. 
    player "Olin, time is a factor in what I'm trying to do for Tirael, especially now that you've given me Belgran as a place to start. If I return with you now and accept that captaincy, I might never find him."

    #30.

The room contains a bar and a number of tables, sitting at which are various granians, mostly men but one or two women as well. Tirael is also there, standing at the bar. He has his back to the bar and is facing the player-character (PC), who stands before him. They are the only lyris in the room.

    #6. 
    player_narration "Tirael bought us an ale each and we drank as we told our respective stories. I didn't mention the sacrifice I had made to be there, I didn't want Tirael to feel guilty over what had been my own decision."
    #7. 
    tirael "I chose Grana – and Belgran – because it would be a fairly simple and short journey, and because as long as I've known it, this city's always offered work for any granian or lyris or anyone else who has skill with a sword."
    #8. 
    tirael "Tialas and his High Council may have taken everything else from me but they couldn't take my sword arm."
    #9. 
    tirael "And with Belgran having its own port, if I felt a sudden urge to jump on board a ship and set sail for some new, distant land... well, the option is there."

    tirael "Look, enough of this "captain"and "sir"nonsense, understand? I'm not your superior officer anymore. Just a disgraced noble in exile."
    #14. 
    tirael "And you don't have to worry about me sailing off into the sunset. I've never been one for boats, so given the choice, I'll keep my feet on dry land."
    #15. 
    tirael "Besides, I've got a job starting tomorrow. The money that Olin gave me is almost gone and a lyrian needs to put food in his belly somehow."
    #16.

    #17. 
    tirael "Thank him for the dagger as well. It came in handy when a cocky young bandit made my acquaintance on the outskirts of the city. If that man used to play the fiddle, I hope he can still do so now with a few less fingers."
    #18. 
    player_narration "Now that Tirael had brought up Olin, I passed on my brother's message as I had said I would. Tirael laughed."
    #19. 
    tirael "Well, you tell Olin he's a lowborn peasant who should have more respect for his betters."
    #20. 
    player "You said you had a job. Doing what?"
    #21. 
    tirael "The first couple of days I was here, I asked around about finding some work."
    #22. 
    tirael "I was told about a merchant living here in Belgran, a man named Quinn. He's based here but mostly he travels around Grana and beyond, peddling his wares."
    #23. 
    tirael "With the increased unrest throughout the lands these days, Quinn was looking to hire extra security for his travels."
    #24. 
    tirael "He asked me to prove my skill with a sword, which I did, and he hired me as one of his bodyguards. Simple as that."
    #25. 
    tirael "His caravan leaves Belgran tomorrow and I'll be going with him. He spends about three weeks out of every month on the road, so I'll be away a lot. But when I'm not with Quinn, you'll probably find me here."
    #26. 
    tirael "Quinn's a bit of a shady character but no worse than a lot of merchants, and the pay is good."
    #27. 
    tirael "So there you go. I'm a bodyguard now. Life does take us down some unexpected paths, doesn't it?"
    #28. 
    tirael "Now, what about you? Why did you come all this way looking for me?"
    #29. 
    player "Because I know you didn't kill your brother. I want to find out who did and help you clear your name."

    #Plot by Katja Alexeeva

    #Script by Alex De-Gruchy




    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. It is the afternoon and so the square is full of people, some passing through or standing around, while others are busy shopping or selling, the square bustling with activity. Player-Character (PC) is standing alone on the outskirts of the square, looking around for any sign of Lyssael.
    #1. 
    player_narration "As the afternoon went on and the sun slowly fled across a clear sky, I felt my hopes at seeing Lyssael fleeing with it, as there had been no sign of her at Lyr-Taer's main square all day."
    #2. 
    player_narration "As I had done for a number of days before this one, I arrived at the square early and staked out a spot at its outskirts, one that allowed me an unobstructed view across the entire square."
    #3. 
    player_narration "And then I spent the day looking out for Lyssael amongst the shifting crowds as lyris' daily routines – whether shopkeeper, shopper, city guard, pickpocket, noble, tourist – played themselves out before me."
    #4. 
    player_narration "But so far, today had been no more successful than any of the previous days – I'd seen no sign of Lyssael."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I'd been tempted to wander by Ashel's house in the hope of at least getting a glimpse of Lyssael, but I knew I shouldn't risk any potential interference from Tirael's father. "
    #6. 
    player_narration "And so I continued to wait."

    #● Lyssael appears amongst the crowds of people at the square.
    #7. 
    player_narration "Until eventually, a particular form walking amongst the crowds caught my eye..."
    #8. 
    player_narration "...and there she was. Lyssael."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I moved quickly, hurrying from my position and advancing across the square while keeping my eyes locked on Lyssael."

    #● PC moves from their position and walks across the square, passing through the crowds and then stopping upon reaching Lyssael. Lyssael turns to face PC.
    #10. 
    player_narration "As I reached her and spoke her name, Lyssael turned towards me."
    #11. 
    player_narration "In that instant, I noticed how distracted and tired she looked compared to the last time I had seen her."
    #12. 
    player_narration "For a moment she viewed me with a nervous frown, apparently seeing a stranger. Then recognition flickered in her eyes, although no smile accompanied it, her demeanour remaining troubled."
    #13. 
    player "Lady Lyssael, my name is [PLAYER NAME]. We met on the day of the Sky Flower Festival."
    #14. 
    lyssael "Yes. Yes, I remember. You were... a friend of my brother's."
    #15. 
    player "That's right. And I still am. In fact, that's why I wanted to speak with you."
    #16. 
    lyssael "Tirael? Has he – is he alright?"
    #17. 
    player "He's alright, considering the circumstances. But even so, your brother is still innocent of the crime he was punished for. What happened to him was wrong, and it's something I'm trying to put right."
    #18. 
    player "If you could spare some time to talk with me, it would mean a lot to me. And even more to Tirael. He needs your help, Lyssael."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Lyssael held my gaze for a few seconds then hesitantly opened her mouth to reply..."

    #● Laerise appears from out of the crowds and walks over to Lyssael and PC, coming to a stop at Lyssael's side.
    #20. 
    player_narration "...and that was when Tirael's former paramour, Laerise, emerged from the crowds around us and strode over to stand at Lyssael's side."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Laerise's face wore a cold scowl as she glared at Lyssael and me, and one look at that face caused Lyssael's mouth to close and her eyes to look down at the ground."
    #22. 
    player_narration "I quickly began to fear that the opportunity I'd waited for was lost, and cursed Laerise's untimely appearance. Even so, I smiled at her and presented a nonchalant facade."
    #23. 
    player "Lady Laerise. A pleasure to see you again. I was just – "
    #24. 
    laerise "Lyssael, giving me the slip while my back was turned... shame on you."
    #26. 
    laerise "I don't think your father would be pleased to hear of you wandering off alone, now would he."
    #27. 
    player_narration "Laerise turned and gave me a pointed look, her eyes cold."
    #28.

    #Location:  Interior of an inn, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in the same inn and ground-floor common room where we found Tirael in Episode 14 of his story. Standing or sitting at the bar, or sitting at tables, are various granians, mostly men but one or two women as well.

    player_narration "I had no interest in protecting Laerise but whatever Tirael had come to think of her since his trial, the fact is that before then, he had been besotted with her."

    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. It is the afternoon and so the square is full of people, some passing through or standing around, while others are busy shopping or selling, the square bustling with activity. Player-Character (PC) is standing alone on the outskirts of the square.

    player_narration "At least once every few days, Laerise would arrive at Ashel's house and then escort Lyssael out and around town."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Laerise seemed to enjoy herself, shopping and flirting with a number of lyrians who crossed her path, while Lyssael simply tagged along, quiet and distracted."
    #7.

    Part 1

    #Location: Lyr-Taer Goods Emporium, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Lyr-Taer Goods Emporium, a large shop selling a wide range of goods: clothes, furniture, fabrics, food and drink, jewellery, etc. Several staff members work in the shop, and a number of customers are currently scattered around, browsing and shopping. Player-Character (PC) is standing in the shop, currently working there. Standing together nearby are Lyssael and Laerise – they are looking at a selection of clothes and haven't noticed PC yet.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I decided to take the direct approach and put my employment at the Lyr-Taer Goods Emporium to use in my business with Laerise and Lyssael."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd use my position at the shop – not to mention my social skills – to manipulate Laerise and remove her as an obstacle, and then speak to Lyssael."
    #3.

    #"PC walks over to Lyssael and Laerise, who turn to face PC."
    #4. 
    player "Good afternoon, ladies. May I be of assistance?"
    #5. 
    player_narration "The two lyria turned to face me, Lyssael managing a brief smile while Laerise scowled."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Laerise recognised me, I was certain of that. But she didn't mention Tirael, and after a moment's deliberation she apparently decided to treat me with the same general contempt with which I'd seen her treat others. "
    #7. 
    laerise "Did I ask for your assistance...?"
    #8. 
    player "I'm sorry for the interruption, I just noticed you browsing the new dress collection that's arrived in stock. Very high quality. You have fine taste."
    #9. 
    laerise "Thank you for stating the obvious. But I'm not made of money – Ulsennor is getting greedy with her prices. She should be careful not to drive away her best customers."
    #10. 
    player_narration "And there was my hook: money. Laerise wanted fine things but didn't like to pay for them."
    #11. 
    player_narration "She preferred to have other people pay for them instead. She had lived a life of wealth and luxury for years as a result of her manipulations."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Now it was time for her to be on the receiving end of such manipulations..."
    #13. 
    player_narration "I took a step closer to Laerise and glanced around furtively, lowering my voice as I leaned in towards her and spoke."
    #14. 
    player "Look, I shouldn't really be telling you this... but if you like, there's a way I can help you get one of those new dresses at a lower price."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Laerise stared at me, considering, suspicious but unable to ignore her greed."
    #16. 
    laerise "Oh really. And how would you do that?"
    #17. 
    player "The staff here are allowed a ten percent discount on any items they purchase."
    #18. 
    player "I know it's not much but I'd be happy to put my discount towards your purchase if you decided to buy one of our new dresses, to save you some money."
    #19. 
    laerise "That brings me to another question: Why would you do that?"
    #20. 
    player "Ulsennor is always telling the staff to use our initiative and keep valued customers happy. And I'm sure we could class you as a valued customer."
    #21. 
    player_narration "With no sign of gratitude, only a satisfied smile at my apparent recognition of her status, Laerise turned away from me and looked over the new dress collection."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Out of the corner of my eye I could see Lyssael staring at me meaningfully, no doubt eager for news of her brother, although she remained silent."
    #23. 
    player_narration "Although I didn't like to do it, I ignored her. Now wasn't the time. Not quite yet. "
    #24. 
    laerise "Perhaps you're sharper than I gave you credit for, assistant."
    #25. 
    laerise "...Alright, I'll consider taking advantage of your discount. There are a few dresses here which might be worth ninety percent of the asking price."
    #26. 
    laerise "Lyssael, come here. Councillor Ashel wants to keep your mind occupied so perhaps there's something here that might bring a smile to even your sullen face."
    #27. 
    player_narration "Lyssael obviously didn't care about a new dress or any discount but she did as she was told and moved to Laerise's side. "
    #28. 
    player_narration "I stood by as Laerise looked over the dresses, offering occasional comments as to their quality. She prompted Lyssael for comment a couple of times but clearly held no regard for her actual opinion."
    #29. 
    player_narration "Eventually, Laerise selected two copies of the same elegant silk dress and held them up before her as she turned to face Lyssael with a smile."
    #30. 
    laerise "Now here's a thought: why don't we both try this one on? It's one of the better dresses here, it's bound to suit one of us."
    #31. 
    lyssael "I don't know, I'm not really – "
    #32. 
    laerise "You're determined to be a hopeless case, aren't you. Unfortunately for you, I won't take "no"for an answer. Come along."
    #33. 
    player_narration "Laerise held out one of the dresses towards Lyssael, who reluctantly took it in hand. Then Laerise told me to wait where I was, before she and Lyssael moved off in the direction of the nearby changing rooms."

    #"Laerise and Lyssael walk off-screen, Laerise leading while Lyssael follows behind. A few seconds pass before the two lyria return, each wearing her copy of the new dress. They walk over to PC and then stand side-by-side, facing PC."
    #34. 
    player_narration "A couple of minutes later, Laerise and Lyssael returned and stood before me, each having changed into her respective copy of the new dress which Laerise had picked out."
    #35. 
    player_narration "The smile on Laerise's face told me that this was just a game to her, another opportunity to feel superior over Lyssael – she didn't doubt for a second that she would look better in the dress than Lyssael would."
    #36. 
    player_narration "Laerise looked at me expectantly as she modelled her dress gracefully while Lyssael looked off across the shop, wanting to get this over with as quickly as possible."

    Part 2

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. A number of customers are currently sitting at several of the tables. Sitting across from each other at one table are Lyssael and Laerise. Player-Character (PC), currently working as a waiter inside the inn, stands off to one side of the room, watching Lyssael and Laerise.

    NOTE: If the player comes to Part 2 after first failing Part 1, they begin with A.1. below. If they didn't experience Part 1, instead choosing the Golden Meadow Inn at the end of Episode 17, they begin with 1. below.

    A.2. player_narration "My failure at the shop had left a sour taste in my mouth, one I was determined to wash out. With the regular visits that the two lyria made to the inn, I was cautiously optimistic. (GO TO A.3.)"

    A.3. player_narration "The first time Laerise saw me while I was working at the inn after our encounter in the emporium, I thought she might decide to make another scene. (GO TO A.4.)"

    A.4. player_narration "But I'd been patient, keeping my distance from her and Lyssael, and with that, Laerise seemed content to simply scowl at me from across the room. (GO TO A.5.)"

    A.5. player_narration "By now, I'd been patient long enough. A minute ago, Lyssael and Laerise walked into the inn, and I promised myself that I wasn't leaving until I'd done what I had to do. (GO TO A.6.)"

    PC walks over to Lyssael and Laerise, who turn their heads to look at PC.

    #Location: Tirael's family home, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● This episode takes place in Tirael's family home, specifically the study in which Callis died. The room is in order, neat and tidy and as finely decorated as the rest of the house. The curtains are closed and the lamps are lit as it is sometime during the night. The only person in the study is Player-Character (PC), who stands in the room.

    NOTE: If the player has broken into the house without Lyssael's aid, they begin this episode at A.1. But if the player has been let into the house via Lyssael's aid, they begin this episode at 1.

    A.3. player_narration "I encountered no resistance – or anyone at all, in fact – inside the house, the live-in staff apparently asleep or occupied elsewhere. (GO TO A.4.)"

    player_narration "There was still no sign of Lyssael and although that concerned me, I had to trust that she had chosen the right time to contact me and was now busy elsewhere, helping me from a distance."
    #6. 
    player_narration "My eyes roamed over the study as I looked for a good spot in which to cast my spell. This was high-level sorcery and I needed to get the details right if I was to uncover what Dahenwar had been hiding."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I'd also only get one shot at this – once the spell was in motion, there was a chance that anyone nearby who was attuned to sorcery might sense it, and I couldn't afford to draw attention to myself."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I looked at a nearby armchair that seemed to be the same one that Callis fell over during the fight. That was certainly a potential spot for the spell."

    #12.9.
    player_narration "Then it hit me: the armchair wasn't standing in the same place as it had been in the vision Dahenwar had shown at the trial. It had been moved since Callis' murder, which meant I'd cast the spell in the wrong place. "#(GO TO 12.10.)

    #● We are in the ground-floor common room of the same inn from Episode 14. Sitting at the bar and tables are various granians, mostly men but one or two women as well. Tirael and Player-Character (PC) are sitting at opposite ends of a table, facing each other as they talk and drink, each one holding a mug of ale in one hand.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Over a mug of ale, I told Tirael what had transpired at his father's house, what my spell had shown me – and what Dahenwar had chosen not to show at the trial."
    #2.

    Part 1

    #Location: High Council Chambers, Lyr-Taer (Day)
    #● We are inside the capital city's High Council Chambers, where Tirael's trial took place. The tall windows let in daylight from outside. Tialas sits in the same seat as before, flanked by the members of his High Council, including Ashel and Commander Hael. Several guards stand at the edges of the room, while a number of civilians sit on the pews that act as the public gallery, watching the proceedings.
    The trial of Kiaris is about to come to a conclusion in the chambers – Kiaris stands in the spot where Tirael stood at his own trial, a guard standing on either side of him.
    * NOTE: At this point, Dahenwar no longer sits on the High Council, which has led to one of the following:
    1. If Player-Character (PC) has become the new Archmage, they now sit in Dahenwar's former seat on the council while Alirienne sits amongst the civilians on the pews.
    2. If Alirienne has become the new Archmage, she now sits in Dahenwar's former seat on the council while PC sits amongst the civilians on the pews.

    #6. 
    kiaris "No, you can't do this! It's a lie, I'm innocent!"

    tialas "Guards, take him away."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Kiaris struggled and yelled about innocence and outrage and conspiracies as the two guards flanking him bustled him out through the nearby door."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Kiaris' voice faded as the guards closed the door behind them and led the prisoner away from the chambers. I smiled. Finally, justice had been served."

    player_narration "Although the trial was over, Tialas addressed everyone in the chambers as he delivered some final words, his expression grave."

    player_narration "I did as Tirael said and then withdrew what I found within: a wooden bow."
    #16. 
    player_narration "I turned the bow in my hands, looking it over. There were a couple of small ribbons attached to it and much of the wood had been painted in various bright colours, although the paint was peeling in places."
    #17. 
    player_narration "There didn't seem to be anything noteworthy about the bow, which beneath its colouring and decorations was basic in design and hadn't been crafted with much skill or care."
    #18. 
    player_narration "I hadn't expected a gift but was the bow an anniversary present from Tirael? If so then I appreciated the thought but very much doubted that such a bow would be of much practical use."
    #19. 
    tirael "I know it doesn't look like much. And on the outside, it's not. It's what that bow represents – that's what's important about it."
    #20. 
    player_narration "I looked at Tirael and waited for him to continue. I didn't recognise the bow so it meant nothing to me."
    #21. 
    tirael "One year ago today. The Grana Autumn Fair. Our first kiss. Do you remember how that happened?"
    #22. 
    player "Of course I do. We danced for a while and then I kissed you to shut you up."
    #23. 
    tirael "Yes, you did. But do you remember why we went onto the dance-floor in the first place?"
    #24. 
    player "Because the man who ran the archery contest wouldn't let us compete."
    #25. 
    player_narration "A suspicion formed inside my mind. My eyes narrowed slightly as I looked at the bow once more and then back at Tirael, who was smiling at me."
    #26. 
    player "...Where did you get this?"
    #27. 
    tirael "I bought it. From that ignorant fool who ran the archery stall. It's the bow we could have won if we'd been allowed to attempt the archery contest."
    #28. 
    tirael "When I visited Belgran last week, I came across some of the Autumn Fair organisers. They were discussing and preparing for this year's fair. The archery man was among them, wares in tow."
    #29. 
    tirael "I spotted the bow and it gave me the idea so I offered to buy it from him. He didn't recognise me but was curious as to why I wanted it."
    #30. 
    tirael "Although I'd have preferred to give him a smack in the mouth rather than any money, I paid him enough to forget about his curiosity and part with the bow."
    #31. 
    tirael "I know you and I hadn't spoken about buying each other any anniversary gifts but when I saw the bow, I knew I had to get it for you."
    #32. 
    tirael "Like I said, I know it's a poor piece of work. And the man who owned it was certainly of low quality."
    #33. 
    tirael "But it reminds me of one of the happiest days of my life... and I thought perhaps it might do the same for you."

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. Yandar stands behind the bar although the room is empty of customers except for Player-Character (PC), who is sitting alone at a table.
    #1. 
    player_narration "One morning I received a note from Lyssael stating that she would meet me at the Golden Meadow Inn late that night."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The note was to-the-point, containing nothing but a meeting place and time, but I assumed she needed to see me about Kiaris."
    #3. 
    player_narration "We had to be careful, and in that regard Lyssael had chosen a good time to meet – at this late hour, the inn was empty of customers except for myself."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Although Yandar stood behind the bar, he was busying himself and showed no interest in me."

    #● Lyssael enters the inn. She is wearing a long, black cloak, the hood up over her head. She moves over to PC and sits down at the table, joining them.
    #5. 
    player_narration "I was already waiting for her when Lyssael entered the inn, her movements cautious, her face and figure hidden beneath a long, black cloak and hood."
    #6. 
    player_narration "She joined me at my table and glanced around the room, although Yandar showed as little interest in Lyssael as he did in me."
    #7. 
    player "Are you alright?"
    #8. 
    lyssael "Yes, just... wary. It was risky but I managed to arrange things so I could sneak out tonight. I can't stay too long, though. I'm glad you got my note."
    #9. 
    player "I did, thank you. What's going on?"
    #10. 
    lyssael "Nothing. That's the problem."
    #11. 
    player "What do you mean?"
    #12. 
    lyssael "I haven't been able to find anything. As loathe as I am to do it, I've been trying to spend time with Kiaris so I can uncover something that incriminates him..."
    #13. 
    lyssael "...but the fact is, apart from the show that he puts on in public when it suits him, he cares more about my father's business – my family's money – than me."
    #14. 
    lyssael "He's been brushing me aside because he's been busy worming his way into my father's good graces, and my father is glad for the interest in his work."
    #15. 
    lyssael "With Callis dead and Tirael in exile, I think he's beginning to see Kiaris as a surrogate heir, and Kiaris is playing up to that. It disgusts me."
    #16. 
    player "Ashel has an heir – your brothers may not be here but you are."
    #17. 
    lyssael "A male heir. Someone to take after him, to carry on his legacy. Even if I was interested in his work – which I'm not – my father has some very traditional views on lyria in society."
    #18. 
    lyssael "I've tried everything I can to get close to Kiaris without overdoing it and raising suspicion, I don't know what else to do. I'm sorry."
    #19. 
    player "You've got nothing to apologise for, I know you tried."
    #20. 
    lyssael "...I did have an idea, however."
    #21. 
    player "What?"
    #22. 
    lyssael "The subtle approach isn't working... so we provoke him."
    #23. 
    player "Provoke him how?"
    #24. 
    lyssael "I blackmail him. Anonymously."
    #25. 
    lyssael "I'll write him a letter saying that I know he murdered Callis and I have proof, and that if he doesn't want me sharing that proof with the world then he'll have to pay for my silence."
    #26. 
    lyssael "Kiaris is arrogant but I don't think he'd dismiss such a threat – he knows how big a risk he might be taking if he did. We can rattle him, force him into playing his hand and giving us the proof we need."
    #27. 
    player "I don't know. It's dangerous. Backing Kiaris into a corner could work to our advantage or it might backfire on us. Badly."
    #28. 
    lyssael "Ultimately it's no more dangerous than what we're doing already. Let's face it: we're very short on options. We're desperate."
    #29. 
    lyssael "And I am not going to just give up and let Kiaris get away with what he's done to my family. I'm doing this... with or without you."
    #30. 
    player_narration "Beneath her hood, Lyssael's face was set in a determined expression. She meant what she said, there was no doubt about that."
    #31. 
    player_narration "And although I was wary of the potential dangers involved in her blackmail suggestion, she was certainly right about one thing: we were short on options."

    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. It is the afternoon and so the square is full of people, some passing through or standing around while others are busy shopping or selling, the square bustling with activity. Player-Character (PC) is standing alone on the outskirts of the square, looking around for any sign of Lyssael.
    #1. 
    player_narration "A lot of time had passed since I'd last seen Lyssael. Too much time. By now I had grave concerns that I'd made the wrong choice in allowing her to write that blackmail letter to Kiaris."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I hadn't seen Lyssael since the night she snuck out of her house and visited me at the inn. Early on, I wasn't worried – it was too risky for us to remain in frequent contact anyway."
    #3. 
    player_narration "But as the weeks began to roll by without any word from her, my concern mounted."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I spent several nights camped across the street from Ashel's house, watching for any glimpse of Lyssael, just so I'd know she was safe, but she never appeared."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I also checked other places I knew she frequented, always with the same result: there was no sign of Lyssael anywhere. Something was wrong."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I'd become desperate enough that this morning I decided to spend the day on the square, simply waiting and hoping that Lyssael might pass through at some point."
    #7. 
    player_narration "If by the end of the day there was still no sign of her then I intended to break into Ashel's house and find out once and for all what was going on."
    #8. 
    player_narration "It was an action I didn't want to take but I needed to know what had happened to Lyssael."

    #● Lyssael and Kiaris walk onto the square, side-by-side, although they are on the other side of the square and not near PC.
    #9. 
    player_narration "After several uneventful hours on the square, I finally spotted her: Lyssael, walking along... arm-in-arm with Kiaris."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Relief was mixed with caution: I began to cross the square, moving in her direction, but slowly and using the crowds as cover."

    #● PC moves in the direction of Lyssael and Kiaris but then stops about ten feet away from them.
    #11. 
    player_narration "I approached the pair from Lyssael's side, keeping her between Kiaris and myself as although I wanted to get a closer look at Lyssael, I didn't want to endanger her by alerting Kiaris to my presence."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I saw enough of Kiaris to see that he had his usual arrogant smile on his lips, his attention diverted by some of the more expensive nearby wares as well as some of the nearby lyria."
    #13. 
    player_narration "When I came to within a certain distance of Lyssael, I stopped in a spot where I was confident she'd notice me without Kiaris doing the same."
    #14. 
    player_narration "And sure enough, while nervously glancing around the square, Lyssael's eyes happened upon me."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Her eyes widened momentarily in surprise but that surprise was almost immediately replaced by fear. She was scared."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Wanting to help her, I instinctively took another step forward but she hurriedly raised her nearest hand slightly in a subtle but clear gesture for me not to come any closer."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Lyssael's face looked tired and afraid. There was no sign of the fierce determination I had seen on there when we last spoke."
    #18. 
    player_narration "I hated to see her like this. I wanted to find out what had happened to her and try to help, try to make it right."
    #19. 
    player_narration "But the desperate, pleading expression on her face spoke volumes: Don't."
    #20. 
    player_narration "With some effort, I forced myself to remain where I was. I didn't know why Lyssael was acting the way she was but I had no choice but to trust her judgement."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Kiaris, who still hadn't noticed me amongst the crowds, turned and headed towards the entrance of a nearby shop, pulling Lyssael along with him."
    #22. 
    player_narration "As the pair moved away, I kept my eyes on Lyssael's own until, with that same fearful expression on her face, she finally looked away, facing forward again as she and Kiaris entered the shop."

    #● Lyssael and Kiaris disappear from the square as they enter a nearby shop.
    #23. 
    player_narration "I stood alone on the square, feeling utterly helpless, my fists clenched down at my sides."
    #24. 
    player_narration "I was determined not to let down Lyssael or Tirael. But for now, as much as I hated to do it, it seemed that all I could do was wait. "

    #1.

    player_narration "I waited long enough to feel confident that it wasn't a trap and then I moved in and retrieved the letter. I took a haphazard, winding route home to discourage any potential followers."

    #Location: A spot on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are in a wooded area somewhere on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, a quiet and isolated spot marked only by a notable piece of scenery such as the ruins of an old stone house or a large tree felled by lightning years ago. The area is dark at night, there are no lights to be seen. Player-Character (PC) stands at the edge of the area, surveying it – they are the only person in sight.

    PART B

    #Location: A spot on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are in a wooded area somewhere on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, a quiet and isolated spot marked only by a notable piece of scenery such as the ruins of an old stone house or a large tree felled by lightning years ago. The area is dark at night, there are no lights to be seen. Player-Character (PC) stands at the edge of the area, accompanied by Captain Illinea, both of them surveying the area. Standing behind PC and Illinea are three city guards who Illinea has brought with her.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Captain Illinea had been surprised and sceptical, to say the least, when I approached her with my story and my request."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I didn't recount every detail concerning Tirael and Kiaris and how I had come to be in this situation – so many things had brought us all to this point – but I told her enough."
    #3. 
    player_narration "For a few tense minutes, I wasn't sure whether she was going to arrest me or help me."
    #4. 
    player_narration "She eventually revealed that she had never liked Kiaris and had her own misgivings about him... but that she knew little of my own true intentions and character either."
    #5. 
    player_narration "She said that she and a handful of city guards would accompany me to my meeting with Kiaris..."
    #6. 
    player_narration "...but then topped that off with a warning that I had better not be wasting her time or trying to trick her in some way."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The night of the meeting arrived and we headed out of the heart of Lyr-Taer: myself, Illinea and three of the lyrians under her command."
    #8. 
    player_narration "The specified location was a quiet and isolated spot on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, a dark and lonely place at night. The lights and bustle of the capital could have been a million miles away."
    #9. 
    player_narration "We approached the spot cautiously. Kiaris had specified that I come alone, after all, and despite my asking Illinea for help, I still wanted to draw Kiaris out rather than scare him away."

    #"(IF STEALTH STAT IS BELOW REQUIRED AMOUNT, GO TO 11.1.)"

    #10.2.
    player_narration "Something wasn't right. I stood in silence, my breathing slow and steady. "What is it?"Illinea asked in a hushed tone. "#(GO TO 10.3.)
    #10.3.

    #10.4.
    player_narration "Then I saw them. Scattered around the meeting spot were several figures, each wearing dark clothing and hiding amongst the shadows. "#(GO TO 10.5.)
    #10.5.
    player_narration "I moved closer to Illinea and pointed out the figures to her. Although I'd spotted them, our group was far enough away and obscured enough that I didn't think they had seen us yet. "#(GO TO 10.6.)
    #10.6.
    player_narration "Several minutes passed as we watched the figures in silence, none of them moving an inch. It was an ambush, one meant for me. Kiaris had laid a trap for me just as I suspected he would. "#(GO TO 10.7.)

    player "I'll have to take that chance. Just don't leave me out there too long. "#(GO TO 10.10.)
    #10.10.
    player_narration "Illinea clearly didn't like the plan but she nodded, gave some hand signals to her lyrians, and then they split up and silently crept away into the darkness, skirting around the meeting spot. "#(GO TO 10.11.)

    #● Illinea and her lyrians split up and move off-screen.
    #10.11.
    player_narration "As for me, I strode forward in a calm, composed manner, moving towards the centre of the area. The hidden figures could definitely see me now. My eyes flicked between them as I tried to keep them all within view. "#(GO TO 10.12.)

    #● PC walks towards the centre of the area.
    #10.12.
    player_narration "They continued to wait unmoving, watching me. I tried to keep my hand close to my weapon without making it noticeable. "#(GO TO 10.13.)
    #10.13.
    player_narration "My heart was pounding inside my chest. Part of me expected a crossbow bolt or arrow to fly out of the darkness and pierce it at any moment. "#(GO TO 10.14.)

    #10.15.
    player_narration "Seconds later there was a shout of alarm followed by scuffling in the darkness and more raised voices as Illinea and her lyrians pounced on the ambushers. "#(GO TO 10.16.)
    #10.16.
    player_narration "Just as I was about to rush into the fray to help my companions, one of the figures charged out of the shadows at me, sword in hand. "#(GO TO 10.17.)
    #10.17.
    player_narration "As he came running towards me, I noticed that my attacker was a human man, not a lyris. Not that it really mattered at that moment. "#(GO TO 10.18.)
    #10.18.
    player_narration "My eyes fixed on the man, I shifted my stance and gripped my weapon, preparing myself for combat... "#(GO TO 10.19.)

    #● A sword-wielding man rushes on-screen, heading for PC, but then tumbles to the ground as a crossbow bolt comes flying on-screen and plunges into one of his legs.

    player_narration "...only to blink in surprise as a crossbow bolt slammed into one of his legs, causing him to cry out in pain and tumble to the ground, his sword falling from his grip. "#(GO TO 10.20.)
    #10.20.

    #10.21.
    player_narration "Illinea and her lyrians emerged from the shadows. They were unharmed except for a guard who had been slashed across one upper arm. The wound looked painful but not serious. Illinea held a crossbow. "#(GO TO 10.22.)

    #● Illinea and her three guards walk on-screen and approach PC.

    PART C

    #Location: The city dungeons, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the Lyr-Taer dungeons where criminals are held. Sitting in one of the stone cells is Rulf, the human mercenary who Illinea shot with her crossbow. His cell has a stone floor and ceiling, three stone walls and a wall of iron bars – with a door set into them – connecting the cell to the hallway that runs past it. One of the stone walls features a small barred window that lets in daylight from outside. The cell is bare except for a bed and a bucket. Rulf is sitting on the bed while Player-Character (PC) and Illinea stand before him, facing him. The crossbow bolt has been removed from Rulf's leg.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Apart from his name – "Rulf", apparently – and the fact that he was a mercenary, Illinea had gotten no other information out of her prisoner in the hours since she had brought him to Lyr-Taer and thrown him in a cell."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Illinea's crossbow bolt had been removed from his leg and the wound treated, but still Rulf complained about the pain and his treatment in general. "
    #3. 
    player_narration "When Illinea called me into Rulf's cell to join them, I quickly got the sense that she had run out of patience with the man."
    #4. 
    illinea "I've had enough of this. I want to know who hired you and the other mercenaries who were with you, and I want to know now."
    #5. 
    rulf "...Wild boar sausages."
    #6. 
    illinea "What?"
    #7. 
    rulf "They're my favourite. Go fetch me a plate of them, love, and maybe I'll give you some juicy information in return."
    #8. 
    rulf "Oh, and don't forget the garlic, there's a good girl."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Illinea tensed, her expression hard as she glared at the mercenary. Rulf merely grinned back at her and then winked at me."
    #10. 
    illinea "I don't think you realise the gravity of your situation, mercenary..."
    #11. 
    rulf "Oh yeah? Well, I don't think you realise that I couldn't give a bucket of pig-shit for what you think, lyris."

    #● Illinea suddenly rushes forward and grabs Rulf.
    #12. 
    player_narration "Quick as a darting snake, Illinea suddenly stepped forward and clamped one hand around Rulf's throat, pinning him to his mattress as her other hand clamped around his leg wound."
    #13. 
    player_narration "I had to admit to being slightly startled. Although she may not appear all that intimidating, I was learning that it was wise not to underestimate Illinea. She was deceptively strong and fast, as Rulf was now learning to his cost."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Rulf cried out as Illinea squeezed his still-fresh wound. Although he struggled, she knew how to best use her weight and position to hold him in place."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Illinea's expression showed no mercy as she stared into Rulf's eyes, her face close to his."
    #16. 
    illinea "Now you listen to me, Rulf. I said I'd had enough and I meant it. I'm not leaving this cell until you tell me what I want to know."
    #17. 
    illinea "I've already used you as target practice once and I have a lot more crossbow bolts where that one came from."
    #18. 
    illinea "So unless you want to be buried looking like a bloody hedgehog, I strongly suggest you start talking."

    #● Illinea releases her hold on Rulf and steps back, returning to her original spot next to PC.
    #19. 
    player_narration "Illinea released her hold on the mercenary and stepped back, saying nothing but keeping her eyes on him."
    #20. 
    player_narration "Rulf sat up gingerly, rubbing his throat with one hand and holding his leg wound with the other."
    #21. 
    player_narration "I didn't think that Illinea would actually be as ruthless as she threatened but she had certainly seemed convincing."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Either way, her threat had the desired effect. When Rulf next looked up at us and spoke, his former cocky attitude had vanished, the mercenary now grudgingly resigned instead."
    #23. 
    rulf "...Alright. Ask your damn questions."
    #24. 
    illinea "Who were the others with you tonight? Mercenaries, like you?"
    #25. 
    rulf "Yeah. I've worked with two of them before – Green Tristan and Bernard Whittaker. I didn't know the others, I only met them yesterday."
    #26. 
    illinea "Are they all human?"
    #27. 
    rulf "Yeah. All blokes."
    #28. 
    illinea "What were the names of the others?"
    #29. 
    rulf "I don't know. Our employer told us not to use our real names between ourselves. Being cautious, I suppose. He must not've known that Green Tristan, Whittaker and me already knew each other."
    #30. 
    player "Your employer – who was it?"
    #31. 
    rulf "I'd tell you if I could. I never saw him. Far as I know, neither did any of the other lads."
    #32. 
    illinea "Rulf..."
    #33. 
    rulf "Cross my heart, I swear. We were all contacted with separate letters last week, whoever hired us never showed his face or gave his name. We had to write back as well, we had no other way to reach him."
    #34. 
    rulf "The courier who went back and forth was just a regular courier, he didn't know anything."
    #35. 
    rulf "Whoever it was offered us a lot of money to do a job. He gave us the details, we accepted, and that was it. Paid us half up-front."
    #36. 
    rulf "Doesn't look like I'll be seeing the other half now, does it. That'll teach me not to leg it at the first sign of trouble."
    #37. 
    illinea "And what exactly were you and the other mercenaries being paid to do?"
    #38. 
    rulf "Look, can I get a tankard of ale or wine or something? You've had me in here for hours without anything to drink, my head's pounding, my leg's killing me..."
    #39. 
    illinea "Perhaps when we're finished here. What were you paid to do?"
    #40. 
    rulf "...He gave us a location – the place where you found us – and a date and time. When the time came, we'd be hiding there and waiting for a certain someone to come along."
    #41. 
    player_narration "Rulf focused his eyes on me and gave one brief nod in my direction."
    #42. 
    rulf "We were waiting for you."
    #43. 
    player "Were you hired to kill me?"
    #44. 
    rulf "No. We were hired to kidnap you and take you to an old manor in the forest, about twenty miles west of Lyr-Taer."
    #45. 
    player "What was to happen to me then?"
    #46. 
    rulf "No idea. That's all we were told. But someone was willing to pay us good money to get you there."
    #47. 
    player_narration "I had to wonder at Kiaris' actions. Surely if he wanted me dead, he would have paid Rulf and the other mercenaries to simply kill me at the meeting spot."
    #48. 
    player_narration "But instead he wanted me at that manor, alive. Why? What did he have planned for me? I needed to find out. And the sooner, the better."
    #49. 
    player "Captain, can I speak to you outside?"
    #50. 
    rulf "Hey, don't forget my ale! I gave you what you wanted! No hard feelings, eh?"

    #● PC and Illinea exit the cell, Illinea closing and locking the door behind her. Rulf remains sitting on his bed. PC and Illinea stand facing each other in the hallway outside the cell.
    #51. 
    player "I need to get to that manor and find out what Kiaris had planned for me. The kidnapping failed so maybe he'll be rattled and I can use that to my advantage."
    #52. 
    illinea "Or maybe Rulf is lying. This manor might not even exist."
    #53. 
    player "I think he was telling the truth. Don't you?"
    #54. 
    illinea "...Actually, yes, I do. But it's dangerous to go alone. You don't know what's waiting for you there."
    #55. 
    player "Everything that's happened tonight must have convinced you that I'm telling you the truth about Kiaris. Is there any chance you can help me again?"
    #56. 
    illinea "I believe you that you're tangled up in something, yes, but I'm still waiting for solid evidence that it involves Kiaris."
    #57. 
    illinea "But either way, I can't help you if this manor is that far outside Lyr-Taer. It's beyond my jurisdiction and I can't abandon my duties here. I can't spare any guards, either."
    #58. 
    player "I understand."
    #59. 
    illinea "Listen, why don't I write a letter to Commander Hael? A request for a few of his soldiers to accompany you to the manor? I'll make it nice and official, I doubt he'll refuse."
    #60. 
    illinea "I'll give you the letter and you can deliver it to him at the fort. Then his lyrians can travel with you from there to the manor."
    #61. 
    player "I don't know. I appreciate the offer, really, and maybe it's the sensible option, but I'm wondering if I should just head straight for the manor so I can reach it as quickly as possible."

    #Location: The Forest Fort, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the Forest Fort. Player-Character (PC) stands before Commander Hael, the two facing each other. Hael is reading Illinea's letter, which PC has just handed over. A few soldiers are scattered around the fort.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I hurried to the fort as quickly as I could. I felt time slipping away from me as I travelled but I had to believe that Illinea had been right and that this was the best course of action."
    #2. 
    player_narration "When I arrived, Commander Hael was busy with his duties and didn't appreciate my interruption and urgent request to speak to him immediately. He wasn't about to ignore a message from Illinea, however."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I handed over Illinea's letter and Hael read it with a stern expression. When he was done, he looked up at me."
    #4. 
    hael "What's this about?"
    #5. 
    player_narration "I'd read the letter – Illinea had been very sparse with the details. Not wanting to waste time telling Hael what was already a very long story, I decided to do the same."
    #6. 
    player "Captain Illinea and I have been collaborating on a criminal investigation. This manor might be connected so we'd like to take a look at it."

    player "She couldn't spare her own time or that of her guards but she thought it best I not investigate the manor alone. She hoped you could help us."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Hael grunted in response, neither approving nor disapproving. I stood waiting in silence as he looked down at the letter again. After a moment, he looked back at me."
    #9. 
    hael "You can have three lyrians. One of them will be a ranger, he knows the woods well and will know the best route to get you to this manor you're interested in. When do you intend to leave?"

    player "As soon as possible. And thank you, Commander."

    player "Yes, sir."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Hael nodded and returned Illinea's letter to me. He told me to wait while he went to round up my travelling companions. We'd be leaving as soon as they were ready. I hoped it would be soon enough. "

    *NOTE: If the player chose to take Illinea's letter to Commander Hael in Episode 27 then they experience Part A of this episode.
    If the player chose to travel to the manor alone then they begin with Part B of this episode.



    PART A

    #Location: Dahenwar's Manor, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the wooded area where the manor owned by Dahenwar is located. We have an exterior view of the building and surrounding grounds. The area is quiet and there is no one in sight until Player-Character (PC) and three of Hael's soldiers from the Forest Fort emerge from the front door of the house. They all come to a stop in front of the manor, standing together as a group, PC facing the manor and looking at it.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I'd hoped that my detour to the fort to deliver Illinea's letter wouldn't take too long, that it wouldn't harm my chances of reaching the manor in time to get some answers."
    #2. 
    player_narration "But that was exactly what happened. Because although Hael's three lyrians and I searched the place from top to bottom, the manor was empty..."
    #3. 
    player_narration "...and all signs pointed to it having been vacated only recently and in a rush."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I'd arrived too late and there was no evidence pointing to who owned the manor. It was a dead end."
    #5. 
    player_narration "To be fair, the ranger Hael had given me as a guide did his job well, and all three lyrians had searched the manor as thoroughly as I did..."
    #6. 
    player_narration "...but now they looked at me like this had all been nothing but a waste of time, although none of them said it aloud."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I thanked them for their help and we set off back the way we had come, heading in the direction of the fort with nothing to show for our time and effort."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Commander Hael would be waiting for us. And he wasn't going to be happy with me. "

    #Location: Dahenwar's Manor, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the wooded area where the manor owned by Dahenwar is located. We have an exterior view of the building and surrounding grounds. Player-Character (PC) is standing off to one edge of the scene, hidden behind a bush and facing the front of the manor – they are hiding due to the six human men standing guard outside the front door of the manor. The guards are all armed and they stand together in a group, talking. None of them have spotted PC.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Rulf hadn't needed any more threats from Illinea to be more specific in regard to the location of the forest manor, and after memorising his detailed directions, I left Lyr-Taer in a hurry."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I moved through the forest as quickly as I could without being careless. Eventually I came within sight of the manor Rulf had spoken of."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The building was large and old, and as with the surrounding grounds, not as well-maintained as it might have been."
    #4. 
    player_narration "The manor was located in an isolated spot deep within the woods. You could scream bloody murder at the top of your lungs here and there would be no one around to help you."
    #5. 
    player_narration "The property wasn't empty, however, as I soon discovered when I spotted the six armed humans standing guard just outside the front door."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I had no idea whether these men were the ones who had been hired alongside Rulf or not..."
    #7. 
    player_narration "...but I had to assume they were dangerous and that they wouldn't take kindly to my visit. I also thought it safe to assume that there might be others inside."
    #8. 
    player_narration "The guards didn't see me as I waited patiently in my hiding spot, watching them from a distance and pondering my next move."

    player_narration "Deciding that a discreet approach would serve me best if I was to find any answers here, I thought about what I'd seen of the rear of the manor. "#(GO TO 11.2.)
    #11.2.
    player_narration "I'd spotted an open window at the back of the building, on the second floor. If it was still open now, it might just be my way inside... "#(GO TO 11.3.)

    #● Skip ahead about twenty minutes and cut to inside the manor – more specifically, the cellar of the house. We are in one of the rooms of the cellar, the room featuring a door connected to an interior hallway. The room has no windows and is illuminated by candles.
    The room contains three adjacent cells at one end of it, the cells fronted by iron bars. Each has a door, both closed and locked. Lying unconscious in one of the cells is Dahenwar's wife, Alirienne, although she is partly in darkness.
    Sitting in a chair at a table is an armed guard, a stocky and strong-looking human man. The guard is asleep. Laying on the table in front of him is a key-ring with several metal keys attached to it – one of these keys opens all of the cells.
    PC is standing just inside the room, their back to the hallway door behind them.
    #11.3.

    player_narration "Not only that but I didn't want to draw attention to the lyria before I knew who she was and what was going on here. In regards to keeping a low profile, my family home was a better choice than the fort or Lyr-Taer. "#(GO TO 11.33.)

    player_narration "My father not only trusted my judgement but could also plainly see that the lyria needed help, so he was willing to wait for a full explanation."
    #5. 
    player_narration "He went to work, examining the lyria and then beginning to treat her as best he could. She wouldn't die, he told me, but she had been terribly mistreated and for a very long time."
    #6. 
    player_narration "My mother wasn't home, she was staying with a cousin for a couple of days. Part of me was relieved at that, I didn't want to worry her with all of this."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I waited as my father did what he could for the lyria, applying some simple but tried-and-true healing methods to help her recover. She slept through the whole thing."

    #● Alarad turns away from Alirienne and walks over to PC. He embraces them for a couple of seconds and then steps back, facing them.
    #8. 
    player_narration "Eventually my father turned away from his patient, walked over to me and embraced me. I embraced him in return and then he stepped back, smiling."
    #9. 
    alarad "It's good to see you. We didn't really have time for a proper "hello"earlier."
    #10. 
    player "It's good to see you too. And I'm sorry about all this but I couldn't just leave her."
    #11.

    #12. 
    player "Thanks. So, how's the patient?"
    #13. 
    alarad "I've done all I can for now. She's weak but she should recover."
    #14. 
    alarad "Now... why don't you tell me exactly what's going on here...?"
    #15. 
    player_narration "And so, omitting a few details which I decided my father was better off not knowing, that's what I did."
    #16. 
    player_narration "He listened patiently, asking the occasional question, his expression often thoughtful or concerned. When I was finished, he looked at me with keen eyes."
    #17. 
    alarad "Do you know who she is?"
    #18. 
    player "Something in the back of my mind said she seemed familiar, but I couldn't place her so I stopped thinking about it. Why? Do you know her?"
    #19. 
    alarad "Well, she looks a lot worse than when I last saw her, but this is Alirienne, sister to Tialas and wife to Archmage Dahenwar. She was the Archmage before Dahenwar took over the position."
    #20. 
    alarad "You saw her at some festivals and fairs when you were a child, before she vanished. That's why your mind was telling you that you recognised her – old memories."
    #21. 
    player "That's right, she disappeared decades ago, didn't she. What in the names of the gods was she doing in the cellar of that manor...?"
    #22. 
    alarad "I have no idea. When she disappeared, word was she'd taken a lover and run away with him, just up and left her family and her position."
    #23. 
    alarad "With Alirienne gone, that's when Dahenwar stepped in as Archmage. He lost a wife but gained a lot of power. Some would consider that a worthy trade-off."
    #24. 
    player "I'll tell mum you said that."
    #25. 
    alarad "Not me, you cheeky bugger. Anyway, whatever happened to her and however she ended up where you found her, she's here now and she needs help, so here she can stay until she's well again and we can figure this out."
    #26. 
    player "You don't need to do that. I've already asked enough of you."
    #27. 
    alarad "Nonsense. I'm not going to throw her out in this condition. It's going to be fun explaining this to your mother, though..."
    #28. 
    alarad "Anyway, what's your plan going forward?"
    #29. 
    player "I'll wait here until she wakes up. I'll talk to her, fill her in on what's happened, and then hopefully she can give me some answers in return."
    #30. 
    alarad "Alright. But you look exhausted. Go and sit down and I'll fix us a couple of drinks."
    #31.

    #Location: Main square, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Lyr-Taer's main square, in the heart of the city. It is the morning and so the square is full of people, some passing through or standing around while others are busy shopping or selling, the square bustling with activity. Player-Character (PC) and Illinea stand together on the outskirts of the square, away from the crowds, facing each other and talking.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Taking one of the horses the guards had stabled at the manor, I rushed back to Lyr-Taer as quickly as I could."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Doubt churned in my gut the entire time as I wondered if I'd made a mistake in leaving the imprisoned lyria there alone."
    #3. 
    player_narration "But I'd made my choice and I had to live with it. I just hoped the lyria would as well."
    #4. 
    player_narration "When I was back in the capital, I went looking for Illinea only to learn that she was out on official business, although I managed to track her down on the main square."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Illinea dismissed the guards accompanying her so that the two of us might talk privately. We stood on the outskirts of the square, away from the crowds, so that we wouldn't need to worry about eavesdroppers."
    #6. 
    PLAYER NARRATION Illinea listened intently as I told her everything that had happened at the manor, concluding with how I'd had to leave the imprisoned lyria in the cellar.
    #7. 
    player "I couldn't get her out of there. She needs help. Right away."
    #8. 
    player "I know the manor falls outside your jurisdiction but – "
    #9. 
    player_narration "Illinea held up a hand, indicating for me to stop. She nodded once and looked at me with a level expression."
    #10. 
    illinea "I understand. And you're right – officially, this is none of my concern. But I'll be damned if I'm going to leave a lyria to rot in some godsforsaken cellar out in the forest."
    #11. 
    illinea "I can't go myself but as soon as you and I are done here, I'll send a few of my most trusted lyris. A doctor, too – by the sounds of it, the lyria in that cell will need one."
    #12. 
    player "Thank you."
    #13. 
    illinea "Can you tell me anything else about her? Any clues as to who she might be?"
    #14. 
    player "No. I had an itch in the back of my mind when I saw her, a feeling like perhaps I'd seen her face before, but it didn't last long. I think it was just my mind playing tricks on me."
    #15. 
    illinea "What about the guards?"
    #16. 
    player "As I said, human mercenaries. Some sloppy and fairly unskilled, others more seasoned and dangerous."
    #17. 
    player "Some of them seemed to know each other but I don't think they were a properly organised mercenary company, mostly just random sellswords working the same job. That's the feeling I got, anyway. I wasn't able to question them."
    #18. 
    player "But between the lyria, whatever you can find on the guards, and any other evidence that might be hidden around that house, I'm sure we can find out exactly what's going on."
    #19. 
    illinea "I intend to."
    #20. 
    illinea "I'll go and inform the lyris I'll be sending. You can come with me in case they have any questions. Alright?"

    #Location: A spot on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are in a wooded area somewhere on the outskirts of Lyr-Taer, a quiet and isolated spot marked only by a notable piece of scenery such as the ruins of an old stone house or a large tree felled by lightning years ago. The area is dark at night, there are no lights to be seen. Player-Character (PC) and Illinea are standing together, next to a horse which has on its back the bundled-up corpse of Alirienne. PC and Illinea are facing each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Taking one of the horses the guards had stabled at the manor, I loaded up the dead lyria – who I'd wrapped in a large sheet of cloth – and rode back to Lyr-Taer."
    #2. 
    player_narration "When I reached the outskirts of the capital, I stopped – I didn't think it was too clever an idea to ride into the city with a corpse at my back."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I hid the horse and body in a quiet, isolated spot and then proceeded far enough into Lyr-Taer to find a city guard and give him a message to take to Illinea."
    #4. 
    player_narration "The guard left with my message while I returned to the horse and corpse. About twenty minutes later, Illinea appeared, having followed the directions I'd asked the guard to pass on."
    #5. 
    player_narration "She glanced at the wrapped-up form of the lyria but said nothing about it. Instead she fixed her eyes on me and said, "Tell me what happened."So I did."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Illinea listened intently as I told her everything that had happened at the manor, concluding with my journey back to the capital."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Illinea's only reply was a brief nod before she walked over to the corpse and moved aside enough of the sheet to see the lyria's face."

    #● Illinea turns away from PC and steps over to Alirienne's body to look at it.
    #8. 
    player_narration "Illinea stared at that face for several seconds with a thoughtful frown, tilting her head slightly to get a better look. Eventually, recognition appeared on Illinea's face – I could see it without her having to say a word."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Illinea placed the sheet back over the lyria's face. She looked off into the darkness of the woods."
    #10. 
    player "You know who she is."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Illinea walked back over to me, glancing around as she did so, a troubled frown creasing her brow."

    #● Illinea walks back over to PC, the two of them facing each other again.
    #12. 
    illinea "It's Alirienne, the lyria who was Archmage before Dahenwar. She was also Dahenwar's wife, not to mention Tialas' sister."
    #13. 
    player_narration "For a moment I said nothing as memories stirred in my mind."
    #14. 
    player "...I know who you're talking about. I think I saw her at some festival or fair when I was a [boy / girl]. I knew I'd seen her before somewhere..."
    #15. 
    player "But wait, didn't Alirienne disappear decades ago?"
    #16. 
    illinea "She did. If rumours are to be believed, she had a lover, and the two of them ran away together, Alirienne abandoning her family and her duties as Archmage in the process."
    #17. 
    illinea "As far as I know, no one has seen her since. Dahenwar stepped in as Archmage not long after she vanished. "
    #18. 
    player "If she disappeared decades ago then what in the names of the gods was she doing in the cellar of that manor...?"
    #19. 
    illinea "I have no idea. But I'm going to find out."
    #20. 
    illinea "There's a guardhouse just within the city walls, not far from here. I'll take the body there. It's a quiet area and I can convince the guard on duty there to keep his mouth shut."
    #21. 
    illinea "Because this is Dahenwar's wife and Tialas' sister we're talking about here. That means this is going to get complicated, public and political very quickly. But I'll find out what I can, while I can."
    #22. 
    illinea "Depending on how I handle this, by the end of the week I might be mucking out the stables or settling in for a long stay in the dungeons."
    #23. 
    player "What can I do to help? I'm just as involved in this as anyone."
    #24. 
    illinea "Just leave things to me for now but don't stray too far – make sure I can reach you. Because you're right: you're involved in this up to your eyeballs. And I've got a feeling this is just the beginning. "

    #Location: Dahenwar's Manor, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside Dahenwar's manor, deep in the woods – specifically, a room within the cellar of the house. There is a door that connects the room to an interior hallway outside it. The room has no windows and is illuminated by candles, and contains a table with a chair standing next to it. PC's weapons and items sit in a pile on the surface of the table.
    The room contains three adjacent cells at one end of it, the cells fronted by iron bars. Each cell has a door that is both closed and locked. Laying unconscious in one of the cells is Dahenwar's wife, Alirienne, although she is partly in darkness.
    In one of the other cells is Player-Character (PC), who is also laying on the floor, unconscious.

    #"After several seconds of laying unconscious on the floor, PC opens his eyes, slowly rises to his feet and looks around the cell in which he has been imprisoned."
    #1. 
    player_narration "I slowly awoke from darkness and quickly wished I hadn't, such was the pounding in my head. I blinked several times, the world coming into focus around me."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Although it brought fresh thudding in my skull, I rose to my feet, took a breath and steadied myself, wondering for a moment if I was going to pass out."
    #3. 
    player_narration "When I didn't, I looked at my surroundings, although there wasn't much to see: stone floor, stone walls, wooden ceiling, metal door."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I may have been groggy but I wasn't stupid: I was in a cell. Someone had imprisoned me."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I was unsurprised to find that all of my possessions – apart from the clothes I wore – had been taken from me while I was unconscious."

    #"PC walks over to the cell door and looks through it."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I assumed the door would be locked and I was right. I pushed and yanked it several times but it was composed of thick metal bars and seemed solidly built into the stone around it."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Looking out through the bars and at the room beyond yielded no information about my location or my captors. I didn't even know what time of day it was, as the room featured no windows."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I saw my possessions piled up on a table, far out of reach. I called out a couple of times but no one came and I heard no reply – or any other sound, for that matter."
    #9. 
    player_narration "So I waited. Time passed, although I had no idea exactly how much. Hours, at least."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Eventually, my eyes fixed on the door at the far end of the room as the handle turned and it began to open."

    #"A stocky male guard enters the room through the hallway door, carrying a bowl of stew. He stops just inside the room, looking at PC."
    #11. 
    player_narration "A tall, stocky man entered the room and paused for a moment as we regarded each other. Through the doorway behind him, all I could see was more darkness and stonework. "
    #12. 
    player_narration "The man held a wooden bowl but what interested me more was the large dagger he carried in a scabbard on one hip and the ring of keys he carried on the opposite hip. So this was my jailer."
    #13. 
    player_narration "His curiosity apparently satisfied, the man turned his head and spat on the floor before walking in my direction, his expression flat and hard."

    #"The guard walks over to PC's cell and comes to a stop before the door."
    #14. 
    player "So are you going to tell me who you are and what I'm doing here?"

    #"The guard tosses the bowl of stew through the bars of the door, the bowl landing on the floor of the cell."
    #15. 
    player_narration "In answer, the guard tossed the bowl through the bars of my cell door. It clattered on the floor, spilling some of the thick, brown stew it contained."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Without another glance in my direction, he turned and headed back towards the door through which he had entered. He passed through it, shutting it behind him."

    #"The guard walks back across the room and leaves through the same door, closing it behind him."
    #17. 
    player "I'll take that as a "no", then!"
    #18. 
    player_narration "So it didn't look like I'd be learning anything from my jailer, at least not anytime soon. I gave the stew a brief look but although I was hungry, I decided not to risk it."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Instead I sat on the hard floor and considered my predicament. I didn't know why I was being kept here but the reason obviously wasn't going to be a pleasant one, so I needed to escape."

    #"PC walks over to one wall and sits on the floor, his back propped up against the wall behind him."
    #20.

    #Script by Alex De-Gruchy





    PART A

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. Yandar stands behind the bar while a number of customers are scattered around the room, eating, drinking and talking. Player-Character (PC) sits alone at a table, a plate of food and a mug of ale before him.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The noise and bustle of a busy lunchtime surrounded me as I ate my own lunch at the Golden Meadow Inn, although I sat alone and in silence, preoccupied by thoughts of recent events."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Alirienne had slept in my parents' house for a full night and day before finally waking. Although she was still weak from her imprisonment, she was alert enough for me to explain to her how she had come to be in my parents' home."
    #3. 
    player_narration "She thanked me for rescuing her, and my father for healing her. But even though we were both understandably curious about the circumstances surrounding her imprisonment..."
    #4. 
    player_narration "...she would only say that she had been a prisoner at the manor for years and that she needed to get to Lyr-Taer as soon as possible because there was much she needed to put right."
    #5. 
    player_narration "She requested my help once more, asking if I could escort her to the capital. Despite the efforts of myself and my father, Alirienne would hear no talk of further rest."

    #6. 
    player_narration "Reluctantly I agreed, preferring this option to leaving her to fend for herself, although at the same time I wondered what trouble any further involvement with the former Archmage might be getting me into."

    #7. 
    player_narration "My father gave Alirienne some medicine for the journey, along with one final reminder that she should be recovering in bed instead of travelling. Then my father and I said our farewells, and Alirienne and I were away."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I deliberately kept us at a slow pace on account of Alirienne's condition, and although I could see that this frustrated her, she nonetheless seemed to acknowledge it as necessary – she knew better than anyone how weak she felt."
    #9. 
    player_narration "We spoke infrequently, Alirienne never supplying solid answers or further details when I brought up the subject of her imprisonment and recent past."
    #10. 
    player_narration "At her request, I told her of current affairs across Lyriathis and beyond, and she listened intently. She also asked me about myself, my family, my life. I shared what I was comfortable with and omitted what I preferred to keep to myself."
    #11. 
    player_narration "When we finally came within sight of Lyr-Taer, Alirienne paused and took a moment to stare at the city with the expression of someone who had perhaps never expected to see it again. Then she hurried us onward."
    #12. 
    player_narration "As we entered the capital, she declared we would now part ways – she was keen to begin doing whatever it was that she had returned to do, and she wanted to do it alone."
    #13. 
    player_narration "She promised she would be in touch again soon and asked where she could contact me, so I told her. Before I could say much else, she thanked me again and then disappeared into a nearby alley."
    #14. 
    player_narration "During our brief time together I hadn't managed to get a very clear impression of Alirienne's character, but even so, I hoped she would be safe in the city... and in all honesty, that I hadn't made a mistake in bringing her here."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Weeks had passed since that day and I hadn't seen or heard from the former Archmage since. As far as I knew, there was no word of her on the streets either, so she'd managed to keep her return at least somewhat of a secret..."
    #16. 
    player_narration "...although a dark part of my mind wondered if the reason for that was because she was laying dead in a gutter somewhere."
    #17. 
    player_narration "I looked up from my lunch to see Captain Illinea enter the room and fix her eyes upon me. As I wondered what this was about, she approached my table and sat down."

    #● Illinea enters the room and walks over to PC's table. She sits down in the chair opposite him, the two of them facing each other.
    #18. 
    player "Captain."
    #19. 
    illinea "[PLAYER NAME]."
    #20. 
    illinea "I need you to finish your lunch and come with me. Someone wants to meet with you."
    #21. 
    player "Are you going to tell me who?"
    #22. 
    illinea "No. Just come with me."
    #23. 
    player "...Alright. Ready when you are – I didn't have much of an appetite anyway."






































    PART B

    #Location: High Council Chambers, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside Lyr-Taer's High Council Chambers. The room is large and grand, with tall windows letting in daylight from outside. Sitting in one of the High Council seats is Alirienne, who looks healthy and clean now, and is dressed in fresh, tasteful clothes. She looks much better now than when we last saw her. Standing just inside the room with the main doors behind him is PC, who stands facing Alirienne, the two of them looking at each other. Alirienne and PC are the only people in the room, and the doors are all closed.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Illinea and I left the inn together and I followed as she led me through the streets, presumably in the direction of the mystery person who sought my company."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Illinea was all-business, saying little, even when I expressed my surprise and curiosity at being led onto the grounds of the palace."
    #3. 
    player_narration "We went inside the main building and walked its grand halls until my escort brought us to a stop outside the doors of the High Council Chambers. "In here,"she said, motioning towards the doors."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I entered, wondering what awaited me. Illinea closed the doors behind me as I met the eyes of the lyria sitting on one of the High Council seats. She seemed to be the only person in the room."
    #5. 
    player_narration "The lyria offered me a small, brief smile in a way that suggested we were familiar with one another, although I didn't recognise her. Then it hit me: Alirienne."
    #6. 
    alirienne "Please, come and join me. "
    #7. 
    player_narration "I did as I was asked and walked over to stand before Alirienne while she remained in her chair."

    #● PC walks over in the direction of Alirienne and comes to a stop before her. He stands facing her, the two of them looking at each other.
    #8. 
    player_narration "As I got a closer look at her, I thought it no wonder that I hadn't recognised her at first, given how different she looked now compared to the last time I had seen her."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Her skin was less pale and she had put on some weight, enough that she no longer looked unhealthily thin, and her hair was washed and untangled."
    #10. 
    player_narration "She wore clean and elegant clothing, a far cry from the dirty rags she had worn in the cellar of the manor. All in all, she seemed to have recovered well in the time since I had brought her to Lyr-Taer..."
    #11. 
    player_narration "...except for her eyes. They were the experienced eyes of someone who had suffered, and for a long time."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Although she looked at me with a pleasant enough expression, I couldn't help but notice the cold, hard light that sometimes shone in her eyes."
    #13. 
    alirienne "Thank you for coming. I apologise for the abruptness of my summons and for the captain's silence but my brother has insisted on trying to maintain some secrecy over my return. Still, that comes to an end after today."
    #14. 
    player "No apologies necessary. I'm glad to see you well, Lady Alirienne."
    #15. 
    alirienne "All thanks to you and your father. Truly, I am in your debt."
    #16. 
    alirienne "Again I apologise – I would have liked to contact you sooner after we parted ways but alongside Tialas' efforts at secrecy, my recovery and readjustment also took longer than I hoped."
    #17. 
    player "Of course, I understand."
    #18. 
    alirienne "I pay my debts, [PLAYER NAME]. And as for my debt to you, why don't I begin by giving you what you were previously interested in: the truth behind my imprisonment."
    #19. 
    alirienne "Of course you're familiar with the story of my disappearance all those years ago: my lover, my betrayal of my husband, my abandonment of my son and duties as Archmage...?"
    #20. 
    player_narration "Saying nothing, I gave only a brief nod in answer, feeling like this was the safest option. I felt as if I stood on unsteady ground – I didn't know what Alirienne expected of me or where she was going with all of this."
    #21. 
    alirienne "Of course you are. Just like every other lyris in the land, apparently."
    #22. 
    alirienne "But a story is all it is. A fabrication. A lie which has been considered fact for decades, one created and spread by my husband, Dahenwar, Lyriathis' current "Archmage"..."
    #23. 
    alirienne "...and the lyrian who has held me prisoner for the past fifty years."
    #24. 
    player_narration "I remained silent. This was quite the revelation... but was it the truth? It wouldn't particularly surprise me if Dahenwar was indeed capable of such a crime..."
    #25. 
    player_narration "...but on the other hand, this would refute what had been considered to be common knowledge for many years. And at the moment, Alirienne was the only one making her claim."
    #26. 
    player_narration "Also, why would she make such an important revelation to me? Was it really because I had helped her? Not for the first time, I had to wonder at what would come of my involvement with the former Archmage."
    #27. 
    alirienne "I never took a lover. I was always faithful to my husband. I never loved him and he certainly never loved me but I respected our wedding vows, even if ours was a purely political marriage."
    #28. 
    alirienne "Being sister to the High Lord gave me much but it also came with certain pressures and expectations."
    #29. 
    alirienne "At the time, both Dahenwar and my brother had much to gain from an alliance through marriage, and so Tialas urged me to accept Dahenwar's proposal for the good of everyone. Reluctantly, I did."
    #30. 
    alirienne "We had our son, Kiaris, again out of expectations and politics rather than love, and a child did nothing to bring us closer together."
    #31. 
    alirienne "In fact, over time, all that grew were my contempt of Dahenwar as a lyrian, and his jealousy of my position as Archmage. He coveted my role, my power. He was only half the sorcerer I was and he knew it."
    #32. 
    alirienne "And then came the day he had me kidnapped and taken to that manor in the woods. I have to confess I didn't see it coming. If I have to give my husband credit for something, it's that he can be very cunning and devious when he wants to be."
    #33. 
    alirienne "He visited me in my cell and couldn't help but gloat over his crime. The house – not to mention his hired kidnappers – was surrounded by an anti-magic field powerful enough to negate even my sorcery, so he knew he was safe from me."
    #34. 
    alirienne "He told me about the tale he was secretly spreading, that of my fleeing with a lover. He also gladly revealed the goal that my removal was in aid of: his becoming Archmage in my place."
    #35. 
    alirienne "He told me how he would convince my brother that he was capable and powerful enough to take on the position, and I knew he was right about one thing: given enough time, Dahenwar would convince Tialas."
    #36. 
    alirienne "And so he did. And by all accounts, he has been the selfish, ruthless and inept Archmage I knew he would be."
    #37. 
    alirienne "Far worse than his betrayal of me is his betrayal of our entire race. He's never been able to perform the Spell of Eternal Spring."
    #38. 
    player_narration "Even with all of the shocking information Alirienne had already imparted, the enormity of this last claim startled me and I was unable to hide my surprise."
    #39. 
    player "What? That's – Lady Alirienne, surely that can't be true..."
    #40. 
    alirienne "Only the Archmage can perform the ritual... and as much as he has convinced himself and everyone else otherwise, Dahenwar is not the Archmage. I am."
    #41. 
    alirienne "His renewing of the spell has been a sham every time he has performed it. Smoke and mirrors designed to fool everyone. Because who would question the Archmage's ability to maintain the spell?"
    #42. 
    alirienne "The first time Dahenwar attempted it, he genuinely believed he could do it. He failed but managed to hide that fact."
    #43. 
    alirienne "He came to me in my cell afterwards, demanding I tell him how to perform the ritual. I told him the truth: the ability to cast the spell of Eternal Spring cannot be taught."
    #44. 
    alirienne "He refused to accept this, so he threatened me, beat me, tortured me... but my answer never changed."
    #45. 
    alirienne "I think the only reason he didn't kill me during all those years was because he was afraid that my death would lead to the emergence of a new Archmage – a true Archmage, not the fraud that he was."
    #46. 
    alirienne "So every ten years, Dahenwar has carried out a sham ritual that has had everyone fooled into believing that the Spell of Eternal Spring is as strong as ever. But it's a lie."
    #47. 
    alirienne "Because I can feel it. It's been a gradual process but I've felt the spell's magic growing weaker and weaker as the years have passed..."
    #48. 
    alirienne "...and now it's reached the point that others are going to start feeling it too. Dahenwar knows this. His unforgiveable crime is about to be exposed to the world."
    #49. 
    alirienne "And not just our world, but that of the dahris. Because when the lyris start to feel the spell's magic crumbling, so will the dahris. They'll see an opportunity in that weakness and they'll try to take advantage of it."
    #50. 
    alirienne "Dahenwar has put our race's way of life, our very existence, in danger. The time has come for him to be punished for it, and for me to repair the damage he has caused and rejuvenate the Spell of Eternal Spring."
    #51. 
    player_narration "Alirienne fell silent. My own silence came from being speechless at what she had just told me."
    #52. 
    player_narration "If everything she said was true then the enormity of it was staggering. Was Dahenwar really capable of endangering his homeland and people like that?"
    #53. 
    player_narration "If so and all of this came to light as Alirienne said it would, there would be an enormous uproar, and rightly so."
    #54. 
    player_narration "Once again the same question entered my mind and this time I gave voice to it."
    #55. 
    player "Why are you telling me all of this?"
    #56. 
    alirienne "Because if not for you, I would still be trapped in the darkness beneath that house. When Dahenwar is brought to justice and I begin healing the wounds he has inflicted upon our people, it will be thanks to you."
    #57. 
    alirienne "The truth will soon be known to all but I wanted to share it with you personally. You were patient with my initial desire for secrecy and I'm grateful. Now you have your answers."
    #58. 
    alirienne "Thank you, [PLAYER NAME]. If there is anything I can do for you then please let – "

    #● Alirienne is interrupted when the doors open and Tialas enters the room. Both PC and Alirienne look over at him. Tialas closes the doors behind him and looks at PC and Alirienne.
    #59. 
    player_narration "The sound of the doors suddenly opening stopped Alirienne in mid-sentence and both of us turned to look over in that direction. Expecting Illinea, I was surprised to see High Lord Tialas enter the room instead."
    #60. 
    player_narration "He paused when he saw me, a troubled and suspicious frown on his face as his eyes flicked between me and his sister."

    #● Tialas walks over to stand near PC, although he is facing Alirienne as he talks to her.
    #61. 
    player_narration "Tialas crossed the room to stand near me, although the only attention he paid me was a stern, disapproving glance before he focused on Alirienne."
    #62. 
    player_narration "Tialas looked at his sister with the same expression with which he had regarded me. I didn't know if he was aware of what my meeting with Alirienne concerned, but either way he clearly didn't approve."
    #63. 
    tialas "What damned foolishness is this, Alirienne? I told you to remain in your room."
    #64. 
    player_narration "Alirienne remained calm and composed as she looked back at her brother, unfazed by his displeasure."
    #65. 
    alirienne "Like some kind of shameful secret that must be hidden away? No, I think I've been locked away long enough, don't you?"
    #66. 
    tialas "That's not what I'm saying and you know it. We've discussed this – your return must be handled delicately, there are a lot of things that must be carefully considered and – "
    #67. 
    player_narration "Alirienne leaned forward in her chair, her eyes fixed on Tialas. Once again that hard light gleamed in them, a light that declared she would not be intimidated by her brother or anyone or anything else in this world."
    #68. 
    alirienne "I've had fifty years to consider my return, brother. I don't need any more time to think, and I've already given you more than enough."
    #69. 
    alirienne "Are you really so naive as to think that word of my return isn't already beginning to spread? You may be High Lord but you can't control gossip."
    #70. 
    alirienne "You've had weeks to fret and procrastinate over the political consequences of my return and of Dahenwar's crimes, hiding me away so you don't have to deal with the difficult realities I've brought with me."
    #71. 
    alirienne "That ends now. The people will know the truth and justice will be served."
    #72. 
    player_narration "Tialas glared at Alirienne, his jaw tight. As High Lord, no doubt he wasn't used to people talking to him as his sister did."
    #73. 
    player_narration "He made a brief, dismissive hand gesture in my direction, indicating me without taking his eyes off Alirienne."
    #74. 
    tialas "And what of this one? Have you taken to discussing our business with strangers off the street?"
    #75. 
    alirienne ""This one"is no stranger. [He / She] is the [lyrian / lyria] who saved me. [His / Her] name is [PLAYER NAME] and I would ask that you treat [him / her] with respect for what [he / she] has done."

    #● Tialas turns to face PC.
    #76. 
    player_narration "Still frowning, Tialas turned to face me, grudgingly giving me his attention now."
    #77. 
    tialas "Thank you for bringing my sister home. My family owes you a debt and I would see it paid – what do you seek as a reward?"
    #78. 
    player_narration "Some lyrians would kill to be in the enviable position of having the High Lord in debt to them. I considered how to best use such a valuable opportunity."

    #Location: A road, Grana (Day)
    #● We are on a road somewhere in Grana. It is during the day and the sun is shining. Player-Character (PC) is walking along the road, alone.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I walked along a road in Grana on a morning that was clear and cool, and quiet too: since I'd set out earlier that day, the only other people I'd encountered had been a couple of Granians heading in the opposite direction."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The road ran through a small stretch of woodland, and I made my way through it now, the breeze rustling the grass as well as the leaves which filled the tree branches."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The road was dappled with the sunlight which managed to penetrate the leafy branches overhanging it, the rest in shade."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I was at ease for a while as I walked, but as time passed a feeling began to form in my mind. And eventually I realised what that initially vague but discomforting feeling was: I felt like I was being watched."
    #5. 
    player_narration "A slight tension came into my body and although I continued to walk, I quickened my pace, glancing off into the woods on both sides of me for any signs of who or what might be watching me. But I could see nothing out of the ordinary."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I couldn't say the same about my hearing, however, as I suddenly realised that the forest through which I walked had fallen silent."
    #7. 
    player_narration "There were no birdcalls, no sounds of small woodland creatures scampering through the undergrowth, only the soft wind and rustling foliage, which sounded sinister to my ears now."
    #8. 
    player_narration "The woods were silent and still. Unnaturally so. Something was watching me."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I maintained my quick walking pace, my senses alert, my hand ready to reach for my weapon at a moment's notice."
    #10. 
    player_narration "After about another ten minutes – although it felt longer – the trees began to thin out and the woodland became open fields, the road I walked stretching off into the distance, cresting a hill and then dipping out of sight."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Although I didn't drop my guard, I couldn't help but feel some relief at leaving the forest and being back out amongst open fields with the vast canopy of sky above me."

    #Location: A forest, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in a forest somewhere in Grana. It is night, and in the darkness Player-Character (PC) rests next to a campfire which was burning but has since been extinguished.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The darkness of the forest at night enveloped me as I put out the low-burning campfire I'd been sitting next to for the past hour, warming myself against the chill."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I lay down and pulled my blanket over myself, staring at the dying embers of the fire and the wisps of smoke rising from it."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The woods were alive with the sounds of rustling foliage and small, nocturnal animals, my hearing sharp in the darkness."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I'd hoped to have passed through the forest before night fell but it turned out to be larger than I expected, and in the end I had no choice but to make camp."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I'd been walking for a long time. I was tired and hungry and out of provisions – I'd also hoped to come across a village or travelling merchant so I could stock up, but had no luck."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Just after making camp I'd stalked the surrounding woods, hoping to spot a hare or squirrel I could kill and eat, or at the least some edible fruits or berries, but eventually I returned to my camp with empty hands and a grumbling stomach."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I tried to ignore my hunger and clear my mind now as I closed my eyes, hoping to get some sleep."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I managed to doze for a time, although my sleep was fitful, partly due to unbidden thoughts of food but mostly as a result of the sounds of the forest at night."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Every sudden rustle of undergrowth, snapping twig and creaking branch set me on edge, and although I'd mostly put it out of my mind since it had happened, my thoughts now returned to the day when I felt like I was being watched."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Tense and frustrated, I opened my eyes and sat up. And that was when I saw a large, dark shape – well hidden, but there – amongst the trees about thirty feet ahead of me."
    #11. 
    player_narration "My chest tightened and I grabbed my weapon and leapt to my feet, focusing my eyes on the shape, trying to quickly sharpen my night vision."
    #12. 
    player_narration "But as my eyes focused, the shape became less distinct, and soon all I could make out in that spot was foliage and dappled moonlight."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Even so, I remained on edge, my weapon still held at the ready. Had there really been something there? Or had I just imagined it?"
    #14. 
    player_narration "Carefully and quietly I made my way over to the place where the apparent shape had been."
    #15. 
    player_narration "At first I thought there was nothing there, but when I got close enough I noticed something small – definitely smaller than whatever it was I thought I'd seen, at least – lying on the ground."
    #16. 
    player_narration "It was a hare. It was dead, its neck broken, its eyes open and staring. I touched it and found it was still warm."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Someone or something had been here. Whatever it was, had it left the hare for me? Or had I disturbed it and caused it to flee, leaving behind the dead animal as it went?"
    #18. 
    player_narration "Whatever the truth, I was so hungry that my stomach rumbled at the sight of the hare, my mind thinking about the meat it offered."
    #19. 
    player_narration "I waited a little longer, scanning the woods around me to make sure I was in no imminent danger. When I was satisfied, I put away my weapon, picked up the hare and walked back over to where my blanket and possessions lay."

    #Location: Thornington, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in Thornington, a village in Grana. It is late afternoon and the sun is shining. Player-Character (PC) stands on the village square, talking to William, the village elder. 
    #1. 
    player_narration "When I arrived in the Granian village of Thornington, I immediately knew that something was wrong."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The doors to the houses and other buildings were closed, as were all of the windows, even though it was only late afternoon, the sun still shining. "
    #3. 
    player_narration "Thornington was deathly quiet, and as I made my way towards what seemed to be the village square, the only signs of life I encountered were the occasional muffled voice coming from inside a house..."
    #4. 
    player_narration "...and a couple of faces I glimpsed peeking out from gaps between window shutters. I was being watched, something which had been happening with disturbing frequency recently. "
    #5. 
    player_narration "I came to a stop on the square and looked around at the empty expanse. Not only were there no people in sight but there were no animals either, and I suddenly realised that I hadn't seen or heard any on my way into the village."
    #6. 
    player_narration "No horses, pigs, cows, sheep or anything else. That seemed strange for a rural village like Thornington."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Hoping it wouldn't result in a crossbow bolt being fired at me from a half-open window or some other equally unpleasant welcome, I called out."
    #8. 
    player "Hello?"
    #9. 
    player_narration "Seconds passed in silence."
    #10. 
    player "Is anyone here?"
    #11. 
    player_narration "More silence. But then a sound as the door to one of the houses facing the square creaked open, if only by a few inches. I walked slowly towards it as a middle-aged man appeared in the doorway."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I came to a stop several feet from the doorway, not wanting to frighten the man who, like his fellow villagers, seemed to want to remain hidden indoors."
    #13. 
    player_narration "The man regarded me warily, not stepping foot outside his house. Even from this distance I could see the fear and tiredness on his face."
    #14. 
    player "Hello?"
    #15. 
    william "Who are you? What do you want here?"
    #16. 
    player "My name's [PLAYER NAME]. I've just arrived in the village, I was hoping to buy some supplies for my journey."
    #17. 
    william "Are you a warrior?"
    #18. 
    player "Why do you ask?"
    #19. 
    william "We need help. Our village is under attack by a terrible beast! We sent word to Belgran asking the king for help, but that was a week ago and we've had no reply! We're loyal citizens! It's not bloody right, I tell you!"
    #20. 
    player "Wait, slow down. Why don't you start from the beginning?"
    #21. 
    player_narration "The man took a deep breath to calm himself."
    #22. 
    william "I'm William. I'm the village elder of Thornington."
    #23. 
    william "The beast first appeared about three weeks ago. It came in the night and killed a couple of cows. Then more animals as the days went by. The ones it didn't kill, it scared away."
    #24. 
    william "We were getting ready to go and hunt it down, thinking it might be a nasty wolf that wandered down from the hills... but then one night the beast strolled through the village, bold as brass."
    #25. 
    william "We all saw it. And it weren't no wolf. Almost as big as a horse it was, all claws and fangs. Never seen anything like it in my life."
    #26. 
    william "One of the local farmers, Cribbins, he'd lost all his pigs to the beast, and the night after we saw the creature, he was drunk and riled up and he took his boy, Leonard, with him to find it and kill it. We tried to stop him but he wouldn't listen."
    #27. 
    william "They came back, but not in one piece. One of Cribbins' arms was shredded almost to nothing after the beast attacked them. He'd have bled to death if Leonard hadn't managed to get him back here and to the doctor's house right quick."
    #28. 
    william "Afterwards, Leonard told me they'd tracked the beast to a cave in the forest nearby, and that they'd been lucky to escape with their lives. But I could see that for myself."
    #29. 
    william "I sent word to Belgran the next day. And we've all barely set foot outside our homes ever since. Everyone's too scared, even during the day."

    william "If by any chance you're a skilled fighter then please help us. We're at our wits' end."

    #Location: The forest near Thornington, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in the forest near Thornington. It is early morning, before dawn, and the woods are still dark. Player-Character (PC) stands in a small clearing just outside a cave mouth. Facing PC in the clearing is the large, doglike beast which has been terrorising Thornington.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was still dark when I awoke, made my final preparations and then set out from Thornington, William wishing me luck just before I left his house and he locked his door behind me."
    #2. 
    player_narration "As had been the case the previous day, the only signs of life I saw in the village as I left were glimpses of faces in windows. An old woman nodded at me as I passed her house, and I nodded back."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The night had passed without incident, there having been no sign of the beast in the village, and everything remained quiet now as I entered the nearby woods."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Although the forest was unfamiliar and still largely in darkness at this early hour, I followed the directions William had given me, moving quietly and paying close attention to my surroundings."
    #5. 
    player_narration "After a while I came upon a clearing, at the opposite end of which was the cave William had spoken of, the tunnel within sloping gently down into darkness."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I crouched at the edge of the clearing and scanned the area. The floor of the clearing was churned up in places but I could see no specific signs pointing to a large creature having been here."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I watched the cave mouth for a time but nothing moved there, although I didn't know just how deep the cave went. The woods around me were hushed."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Eventually I rose to my feet again and crept across the clearing, moving towards the cave entrance. I was almost halfway across when I suddenly felt more than heard something behind me. I spun around."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Hurtling across the clearing in my direction was a large, four-legged creature the likes of which I'd never seen before. Its body was thick and powerful and mostly covered in dark hair, its legs pumping as it ran."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Its mouth was filled with numerous sharp teeth bared in a snarl, the nostrils of its snout flared, and its merciless eyes were locked onto mine. For a creature of its size, I was surprised at how stealthy it had managed to be."
    #11. 
    player_narration "So the beast of Thornington was real. And it was upon me."
    #12. 
    player_narration "With no time to defend myself, I settled for evasion, dodging to one side as the creature launched itself through the air at me."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Like its stealth, however, its speed belied its size, and although I was quick, I wasn't quick enough to avoid the beast entirely: one of its claws raked my nearest shoulder and I cried out in pain."
    #14. 
    player_narration "I turned to face the creature as it did the same, the two of us circling each other. I tried to ignore the intense, burning pain in my shoulder and the warmth of my blood running down my arm and back."
    #15.

    #Location: Thornington, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in Thornington, a village in Grana. It is midmorning and the sun is shining. Player-Character (PC) is talking to William just outside the front door of the village elder's house.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I awoke to pain and a light that was all too bright stinging my eyes. I winced as I slowly opened my eyes and realised that the light was sunlight streaming in through a nearby window and directly onto the bed in which I was lying."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Although I felt very stiff and sore – my shoulder and hip where the beast had clawed me felt particularly bad – I was alive. I hadn't ended up as the creature's breakfast after all."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I cursed myself for passing out and being helpless, then thought about the black tiger. It had saved my life. I needed to know if it was alright."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I pulled aside the bedsheet which covered me and saw that someone had treated and dressed my wounds while I'd been unconscious."
    #5. 
    player_narration "My movements were slow and reluctant as I got out of bed. I grunted at a sudden stab of pain in my hip."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I recognised the room I was in as William's spare bedroom, the same room in which I'd spent the night before setting out to kill the beast."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Sitting in a neat pile on a chair were my clothes, cleaned and mended. I put them on, collected my equipment which was piled nearby, and went downstairs. A quick look into each room revealed that William wasn't at home."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I opened the front door and stepped outside. The village square was positively bustling compared to how it had been previously, with around twenty people in view, going about their business. There were no shuttered windows now."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Many of the villagers looked over at me with curiosity as I emerged from the house. I spotted William talking to a stocky young man carrying a barrel."
    #11. 
    player_narration "William gave me a wave, which I returned, then he finished his conversation with the young man and crossed the square in my direction. He came to a stop before me, his manner far more relaxed now than when I'd last seen him."
    #12. 
    william "You're up and about then. How are you feeling?"
    #13. 
    player "I've been better. How long was I unconscious?"
    #14. 
    william "Almost a fortnight now."
    #15. 
    player "Damn. Well, I'm still alive. I suppose I have you to thank for that."
    #16. 
    william "I was happy to put you up at my house while you healed, but it was the doctor who did the work on you, and the soldiers who saved you from the beast and brought you back to the village."
    #17. 
    player "Soldiers?"
    #18. 
    william "The squad sent from Belgran. They finally arrived. Not long after you set out that morning, in fact. You're lucky they got to you when they did."
    #19. 
    player "I don't remember any soldiers..."
    #20. 
    william "I'm not surprised, they said you were out cold and lying in a pool of your own blood when they found you. The beast was there as well, and surely would've eaten you if not for the soldiers."
    #21. 
    player "The beast..."
    #22. 
    player "Wait, how many animals did the soldiers say there were?"
    #23. 
    william "Well, just the one, of course. The beast. A black tiger, of all things. How such a creature ended up here I'll never know. Thank the gods the soldiers were able to stop it."
    #24. 
    player_narration "My heart sank at the thought of that tiger coming to my rescue only to be killed for its trouble."
    #25. 
    player "The guards are sure it was a black tiger? They saw no other animal in that clearing?"
    #26. 
    william "It was a tiger, alright. I saw the animal with my own eyes. And yes, it was just you and the tiger."
    #27. 
    william "...Are you feeling alright? You look a bit peaky. Perhaps you should rest a little longer."
    #28. 
    player_narration "If William was right then the actual beast must have fled before the soldiers arrived, and then the soldiers attacked the tiger by mistake."
    #29. 
    player "The tiger: did the soldiers kill it?"
    #30. 
    william "Many of us here wish they had done for all the trouble that thing caused, but no. They wounded it and captured it."
    #31. 
    player "Where are they now? The soldiers and the tiger?"
    #32. 
    william "They were only here for a few days. A travelling circus happened to pass by, and they offered to buy the animal from the soldiers. The commander accepted and that was that. The soldiers went back to Belgran."
    #33. 
    player "And the circus? Which way did it go?"
    #34. 
    william "They headed north. Why do you ask?"
    #35. 
    player_narration "I owed that tiger my life. It was in its current position because of me, I couldn't just abandon it now. But me telling William the truth would make no difference. I needed to get moving and catch up with that circus."
    #36. 
    player "No reason."
    #37. 
    player "Well, thank you for letting me recover at your home, I appreciate it. But I really should get back on the road."

    william "Of course. And it was no trouble. You tried to help us, after all."
    #39. 
    william "There'll, uh, be no reward, you understand. It was the soldiers who took care of the beast, after all, not you."
    #40. 
    player "That's fine."
    #41. 
    player_narration "I shook William's hand and we said our goodbyes. I bought some supplies for the journey and then set out from Thornington. "

    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is fairly busy, with customers drinking at tables or at the bar. Working behind the bar is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) is sitting alone at a table with a drink in his hand.

    player_narration "I was only dimly aware of the front door of the tavern opening as I was too busy staring into my half-empty tankard, and so I was a little surprised when a few seconds later a figure suddenly sat down in one of the empty chairs at my table."

    player_narration "I looked up from my ale and into the face of a woman wearing a cloak and hood. Her eyes darted around nervously for a moment before they settled on mine..."
    #6.

    #7. 
    eli "You were right. What you said about animals. I've hated seeing that tiger being treated so badly since it's been with the circus. It's not right."
    #8. 
    player "So why haven't you done something about it?"
    #9. 
    eli "...Because I was scared. The circus may be all smiles and colours and fun on the outside, but it's not like that behind closed doors. If I was caught trying to free that tiger, I'd be whipped to within an inch of my life."
    #10. 
    player "Why are you telling me all this?"

    eli "I... I was hoping you might want to help me."
    #14.

    #19. 
    player "Sounds a little too simple."
    #20.

    #22.

    player "Let's go. You can fill me in on other details along the way."
    #24. 
    player_narration "Eli and I left the Moon and Sabre together and made our way through the night to the circus, which was still camped in the field where the fair had taken place."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Despite a close call at one point, Eli's plan worked, and after I'd opened the cage and calmly encouraged the exhausted creature to leave with me, I led it away from the circus and into the nearby patch of woodland."
    #26. 
    player_narration "Eli joined me soon afterwards as she wanted to see the tiger free with her own eyes. She couldn't stay long, however: while the plan had worked, the alarm would soon be raised when the cage was found to be empty."
    #27. 
    player_narration "She thanked me for my help and I thanked her in turn for the opportunity. She gently stroked the tiger's head then headed back in the direction of the circus. I hoped she would be alright."

    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is night and we are in the main room, which is illuminated by a number of lanterns. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and eating as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is Meda. Player-Character (PC) and Kivrin are sitting together at a table.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I'd arranged to meet Kivrin for a drink at the Moon and Sabre, and I made sure to arrive on time. I bought myself an ale, took a seat at one of the empty tables and waited."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I didn't have to wait long, as Kivrin entered the tavern just a few minutes later. She paused and her eyes roamed the room for a moment before they met mine. We smiled at each other."
    #3. 
    player_narration "She crossed the room to my table and I noticed her and Meda glance at each other on the way. I stood up to greet her and she kissed me on the cheek and sat in the chair opposite mine."

    player "You look lovely."
    #5. 
    kivrin "Thank you. You're looking good yourself. You haven't been waiting long, have you?"

    player "No, not at all. Can I buy you a drink?"
    #7. 
    kivrin "I'll have a glass of red wine, please."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I walked over to the bar and ordered the wine, paid for it, and then carried the glass back to our table. I placed the wine before Kivrin and sat back down in my seat. We sipped our drinks."
    #9. 
    player "I'm glad you came."
    #10. 
    kivrin "Don't worry, I'm not the type of girl to stand someone up. I've been looking forward to it."
    #11. 
    kivrin "It feels a little strange, though, relaxing in here as a customer rather than working. Strange in a good way, don't get me wrong."
    #12. 
    player "That's right, you said you worked here. To be honest, I was surprised when you told me that, I don't think I've ever seen you in here before."
    #13. 
    kivrin "It's only part-time, alongside my other job. And I'm not usually out here, I'm usually in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning. Some of my hours are early in the morning too, before Meda opens up."
    #14. 
    player "Ah. That explains why I haven't seen you then. Because I'm sure I'd have remembered."
    #15. 
    kivrin "Oh, I'm sure you would, I'd be the girl all scruffy and covered in dirt and grease."
    #16. 
    player "So obviously you know Meda, then."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Kivrin nodded and I noticed her smile falter."
    #18. 
    kivrin "Yes, very well, in fact. My father was married to her."
    #19. 
    player "So they're not together anymore?"
    #20. 
    kivrin "My father died two years ago."
    #21. 
    player "I'm sorry to hear that."
    #22. 
    kivrin "It's alright. Meda was his second wife. His first – my mother – died when I was young. The Moon and Sabre was his... until he died and left it to Meda in his will."
    #23. 
    player "So do you live here with Meda?"
    #24. 
    kivrin "No, I've got my own room in a shared house at the other end of the city. It's small but it's mine. Well, I rent it anyway."

    #45. 
    player_narration "She kissed me back and we stood like that for a few seconds before finally parting. We were both smiling but Kivrin was blushing as she avoided my eyes. She seemed a little embarrassed."

    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is early in the day and we are in the main room, which is illuminated by daylight entering through the windows. The tavern is quiet, with just a handful of men and women scattered around the room, eating or drinking. Working behind the bar is Meda.

    #21.

    #22. 
    player_narration "Surely not: it was just a kiss, and how would Meda have even known about it anyway?"
    #23. 
    player_narration "I held onto my temper as Meda and I stared at each other across the bar."
    #24. 
    player "Alright, whatever happened between you and Kivrin is your business. But I'd still like to talk to her, so could you at least tell me where she lives?"

    meda "Take your hands off my bar and go cool off somewhere for a while or you can have a chat with the city guard instead. And that's me being nice."
    #30. 
    player_narration "We glared at each other in tense silence until I leaned back and removed my hands from the bar. Despite my anger, I knew that causing trouble here wouldn't help matters. I'd find Kivrin without Meda's help."
    #31. 
    player_narration "I turned and left the tavern, slamming the door behind me as I stepped outside."
    #32. 
    player_narration "I breathed slowly and deeply in an effort to calm down. I looked around: the street was crowded with people, but not the one person I was looking for. I walked away from the Moon and Sabre, wondering what to do next. "

The tavern is filled with people, some drinking at tables or the bar while others dance as a group of musicians play in one corner of the room.

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with customers drinking at tables or at the bar. Working behind the bar is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) has just entered the tavern. Mei is sitting at a table with three Granian mercenaries, drinking and playing cards.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I left the cold night air behind me and entered the Moon and Sabre. There were a few customers scattered around the room, including one fairly rowdy group playing cards and drinking at a corner table."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Thinking that I'd have a drink before heading up to my room, I started walking towards the bar, but then stopped when something caught my eye."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Looking again in the direction of the rowdy table, I saw that the three men sitting there seemed to be Granian mercenaries or at least military men of some kind, battle-hardened and armed as they were."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Their appearance in the tavern wasn't surprising, the Moon and Sabre attracted all sorts of customers. What was surprising was the identity of the fourth person playing cards and drinking at the table: Mei."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I stared in surprise, wondering what the hell Mei was doing in the company of such men – she stood out like a sore thumb."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Physically, anyway. As for her behaviour, she was drinking and laughing and slamming cards down on the table just as heartily as her companions."
    #7. 
    player_narration "There were a number of empty mugs and shot glasses scattered around the table. Apparently the party had been going on for some time."
    #8. 
    player_narration "While Mei certainly seemed to be having fun, I thought I'd better check on her to make sure she was alright."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I walked over to the table and came to a stop before it. The men all looked up at me, the conversation suddenly dying down, and although a couple of them were smiling, there was no trace of warmth in their eyes."


    #10. 
    player_narration "Mei was the last to notice me. Like the others seated at the table, it was obvious that she'd been drinking, but she was in a worse state than the three men."
    #11. 
    player_narration "It took a second for her eyes to focus on me, and when she recognised me a sloppy grin appeared on her face."
    #12. 
    mei "Hey, [PLAYER NAME]! My old pal!"
    #13. 
    mei "Lads, this is [PLAYER NAME]. [PLAYER NAME], these are, uh... bloody hell, I've forgotten your names!"
    #14. 
    player_narration "Mei laughed like she'd said something funny, but neither I nor any of the men at the table joined in. They simply continued to stare at me as my eyes roamed over them."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Up-close, it was obvious that these were dangerous men. However Mei had gotten herself into this situation, it seemed for the best that I get her out of it."
    #16. 
    player_narration "At the same time, part of me was angry: once again Mei had gotten herself into trouble – or potential trouble, at least – and once again it was up to me to deal with it."
    #17. 
    player_narration "She didn't seem to learn, and neither had she bothered to make the effort to come and see me since the last time I helped her out."
    #18. 
    mei "I can't remember their names, but anyway, these lads are all mercenaries! Mad, isn't it? You should hear some of the stories they've been telling me about the things they get up to!"
    #19. 
    player "Another time, maybe."
    #20. 
    player_narration "I walked around the table to where Mei sat, and gently placed a hand on her nearest shoulder. The three mercenaries watched me in silence. Mei was utterly oblivious of the tension."
    #21. 
    player "It certainly looks like you've been putting the drinks away. Don't you think you've had enough for one night?"
    #22.

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is fairly busy, with customers drinking at tables or at the bar. Working behind the bar is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) is sitting at the bar, drinking. The three Granian mercenaries from Episode 4 have just entered the Moon and Sabre.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I sat alone at the bar in the Moon and Sabre, slowly drinking an ale, in a dark mood as I dwelled on the recent argument I'd had with Mei."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd seen her in the tavern a couple of times since the night she drunkenly stormed out, but only from a distance – either she or I had been in the middle of something else and so I didn't get the chance to talk to her."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Although I wasn't even sure what I'd say to her if we did talk. Part of me wanted to make sure she was alright and put the incident behind us..."
    #4. 
    player_narration "...while another part of me wanted to demand an apology for how she'd treated me, and to tell her to grow up."
    #5. 
    player_narration "It didn't matter at the moment anyway, as there was no sign of her at the Moon and Sabre tonight, and I was probably going to call it a day once I'd finished my drink."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I heard the front door open. I glanced over in that direction and then felt myself tense as an already crappy night suddenly got even worse."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Walking through the front door and into the room were the three Granian mercenaries who Mei had been sitting with on the night she stormed out."
    #8. 
    player_narration "They were laughing and talking amongst themselves as they entered, but all of that died down as soon as they spotted me. I turned my attention back to my drink, hoping to simply finish it in peace and then go to my room."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Keeping my eyes ahead and my right hand wrapped around my mug, I heard the men approaching the bar, and of course they made a point of walking to the spot where I was sitting. Two of them stood on my right side, the third on my left."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Here we go, I thought."
    #11. 
    player_narration "The man on my left was tall and thin, with long, greasy hair. On my right stood the scarred, heavyset man, along with the third man, who had a thick, black beard and tattoos covering his forearms."
    #12. 
    LONG-HAIRED MERCENARY: Well, well. Look who it is, lads. Our old pointy-eared friend.

    #Location: King Eadgar's castle, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically the main hall. It is night, the hall illuminated by numerous torches and candles. A couple of long tables are filled with food and drink, and the rest of the room is filled with people talking and drinking. Most of them are Granians but there are also a number of Lyris present, Councillor of Finance Ashel among them. Player-Character (PC) and Mei stand together amongst the crowd.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Mei and I had been seeing each other more frequently since we'd spent the night together at the Moon and Sabre, and she hadn't actually gotten us into any trouble during that time, which was a nice change."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I enjoyed the time we spent together, and I started thinking about how I might be able to impress her, do something special for her."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Then I learned of the upcoming Lyris embassy party which was to be held at King Eadgar's castle, and as one of the small number of Lyris in Belgran, I made enquiries as to whether I could attend alongside a guest."
    #4. 
    player_narration "As well as hopefully being an impressive and enjoyable event, I thought that perhaps the party might help Mei to learn a little more about Lyris culture."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I was pleasantly surprised when my request was approved by the embassy and I received two invitations. I kept the whole thing from Mei, wanting it to be a surprise."
    #6. 
    player_narration "When the day of the party arrived, I simply told Mei that I'd be taking her out in the evening and that she should wear something nice. She was excited – she loved surprises."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Evening came and when we were ready, we walked to the castle. I showed our invitations to the guards at the front gate and then led Mei inside."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Mei seemed curious but not as impressed as I thought she might be. But then I thought of how she came from a wealthy family herself, so perhaps such a grand setting wasn't all that new to her."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Now we stood together amongst the crowd which filled the main hall of King Eadgar's castle, the crowd being made up almost entirely of Granians and Lyris, the majority of which were nobles of some kind, or at least wealthy."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Everyone wore fine clothes, a group of musicians played music on a small dais, and plenty of food and drink had been laid out on a couple of tables. It was a grand event, without being ostentatious."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Mei looked more beautiful than ever and I couldn't keep my eyes off her as we mingled. Initially I'd been a little sceptical as to how we might be received at the party..."
    #12. 
    player_narration "...but apart from disdainful glances from a few of the obviously more arrogant guests, everyone else was polite enough."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Mei was on her best behaviour, being gracious and charming, chatting with me as well as other guests, but after a while I couldn't help feeling like she was becoming bored with the party and that she'd rather be somewhere else."
    #14. 
    player_narration "I leaned in closer to her as I spoke now, not wanting anyone nearby to overhear the conversation."
    #15. 
    player "Are you alright?"
    #16. 
    mei "Of course, why?"
    #17. 
    player "It's just you don't seem to be enjoying yourself that much."
    #18. 
    mei "I'm fine. Really. "
    #19. 
    player_narration "Mei looked down at the glass she held in one hand, and swirled the small amount of wine left at the bottom of it. She looked at me and smiled."
    #20. 
    mei "I could do with another drink, though. Why don't you finish yours and I'll go and get us a couple of full ones?"
    #21. 
    player_narration "I wasn't totally convinced but decided not to push the matter. I drained the remaining wine in my glass and handed it to Mei. She kissed me and then turned and walked away. I watched her go until she was swallowed up by the crowd."
    #22. 
    player_narration "I stood alone, my eyes roaming around the room and over the other guests as they talked and ate and drank. Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone approaching me, and I turned in that direction."
    #23. 
    player_narration "Ashel, the Lyris Councillor of Finance – and the lyrian I knew to be the head of the Lyris embassy in Belgran – came to a stop before me, a glass of wine held in one hand."
    #24. 
    player_narration "He smiled and offered me his free hand. I shook it."

    ashel "[PLAYER NAME], isn't it?"
    #26. 
    player "Councillor Ashel. I didn't expect you to know my name."
    #27. 
    ashel "Knowing which of our citizens are present in Belgran is part of my job as ambassador here. And there was your invitation request, of course."
    #28. 
    ashel "So, how are you finding Grana's capital city?"

    #29. 
    player "I like it, on the whole. Obviously there are some big difference between here and back home, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
    #30. 
    ashel "Of course. Sheltered lives can all too easily breed ignorant minds."

    #Location: King Eadgar's castle, Belgran, Grana (Day)
    #● We are in King Eadgar's castle, specifically a study which is currently serving as the Lyris embassy while Councillor of Finance Ashel and his companions are in Belgran. The room contains some bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a couch, a desk and two chairs. Daylight enters through a couple of windows, and there is one wooden door, currently closed. Ashel is sitting behind the desk while Player-Character (PC) stands on the other side of the desk, facing him.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Inside King Eadgar's castle, I entered the large study which served as the Lyris embassy for Grana."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Gaining access to the castle hadn't been easy. After stating my business at the front gate, I was told that Councillor Ashel was busy and wouldn't be able to see me at the moment. I told the guards I'd wait."
    #3. 
    player_narration "And wait I did. For almost two hours. Eventually a servant emerged from the castle and said that Ashel was ready to see me now."
    #4. 
    player_narration "After leading me to the study, the servant departed. Now, I closed the door behind me and stood looking across the room at Ashel, who sat behind a large desk, his fingers steepled before him."
    #5. 
    player_narration "He smiled a thin smile and gave a small nod in the direction of the empty chair on the opposite side of the desk."
    #6. 
    ashel "[PLAYER NAME]. Take a seat."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I approached the desk and sat in the offered chair, although I had no intention of relaxing. This wasn't a social call."
    #8. 
    ashel "Can I get you a drink?"
    #9. 
    player "Where's Mei?"
    #10. 
    ashel "Straight to business, then."
    #11. 
    ashel "The kiarteh is no longer any of your concern. Whatever relationship existed between the two of you is over and best forgotten. You will not enquire about her after today, and you will not seek her out."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I felt my jaw tighten and had to stop my hands instinctively clenching into fists. I had no doubt my anger was apparent, but Ashel didn't react to it, instead continuing to look at me with an assured, businesslike expression."
    #13. 
    player "And why would I do that?"
    #14. 
    ashel "Because Mei is the daughter of Tanragir, king of Kron-Gantir."
    #15. 
    player_narration "I sat back, stunned. That was a revelation I hadn't been prepared for."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Mei had said her family was rich and powerful, yes, but the daughter of the king...?"
    #17. 
    ashel "She was betrothed to Venryk, younger brother to the Dahris Greatlord, Jhaeros. Until she disappeared following an unfortunate incident involving her carriage and an unwitting group of bandits."
    #18. 
    ashel "Since then her father has had people searching for her all across Grana and other countries. And yet here she was all along, in the heart of the kingdom."
    #19. 
    ashel "Tanragir called off the marriage. He blamed Mei's disappearance on the Dahris, saw it as them failing to protect his daughter as had been agreed upon. The Dahris disagreed, of course, and relations between the two nations only became colder."
    #20. 
    ashel "The whole situation has been a boon for our people. But even so, it's for the best that it not be directly connected to the Lyris in any way."
    #21. 
    player_narration "There was a meaningful pause as Ashel stared at me. I glared back at him."
    #22. 
    player "Meaning me. That's why you want me to stay away from mei "politics.""
    #23. 
    ashel "You can say the word with as much disdain as you like, it doesn't change the realities of the world in which we live."
    #24. 
    ashel "Consider this genuine advice, [PLAYER NAME]: forget the kiarteh."
    #25. 
    player_narration "I thought about Mei. About the prospect of never seeing her again. And I knew that whether or not Ashel's advice was genuine made no difference to me. I fixed my gaze on the councillor."
    #26. 
    player "I can't do that."
    #27. 
    player_narration "I rose from my chair, Ashel watching me in silence. I assumed he was perceptive enough to realise that any further effort spent trying to convince me would be a waste of breath."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I walked away from the desk, first leaving the study and then the castle. I hadn't bothered to press Ashel on Mei's whereabouts because he obviously had no intention of telling me."
    #29. 
    player_narration "But that was fine. I'd find out what I needed to one way or another. And one way or another, I'd see Mei again. "

    #Location: Kiartar Trade Outpost, Grana (Day)
    #● We are at the Kiartar trade outpost that straddles the border between Grana and Kron-Gantir. It is sometime during the day. A number of small buildings and large tents make up most of the outpost, most of which are run by Kiartar merchants selling wares of some kind. Some Kiartar and Granians wander around the area. Player-Character (PC) stands on a dirt road that runs through the outpost.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I stood on a dirt path that ran through the Kiartar trade outpost, my eyes roaming over the small buildings and large tents that made up the majority of the outpost, the wind picking up some dust off the path and swirling it around."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Most of the buildings and tents were manned by Kiartar merchants selling wares of some kind, while people who'd come to trade went about their business."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Most of these people were Granians or Kiartar, no surprise given that the unnamed outpost straddled the border between the two countries."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Rather than scouring Belgran in an attempt to find answers regarding Mei's disappearance – an attempt which Councillor of Finance would've no doubt done his best to stop – I decided to go straight to her father, Tanragir."
    #5. 
    player_narration "But since the Kiartar were very strict when it came to who they allowed into their country, I thought that a potential first step in achieving this could be to visit the trade outpost and hopefully proceed from there."
    #6. 
    player_narration "But now that I was here, I wasn't so hopeful. The handful of Kiartar I'd spoken to about entering Kron-Gantir quickly made it clear they had no interest in what I wanted unless it involved buying something from them... "
    #7. 
    player_narration "...and although I stood in a place that straddled its border, as long as the border itself remained as tightly sealed up as it was, Kron-Gantir remained as far out of reach as if I was still in Belgran."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Although I wasn't ready to write off the trade outpost as a lead just yet, perhaps it was time I started thinking of other options as well. Because whatever it took to find Mei, I was prepared to do it."

Yandar stands behind the bar while a few customers are scattered around the room, eating, drinking and talking. Player-Character (PC) and Melas sit together at a table in a corner of the room.

    #5. 
    melas "What's this about?"
    #6. 
    player "Obviously you're a lot more informed on the Thieves' Guild than I am, so I was wondering: does the guild have any members or contacts in Kron-Gantir?"
    #7. 
    melas "Why?"
    #8. 
    player "Because I need to get into the country, and as you know, that's not an easy thing to do. I was hoping the guild might be able to help – sneaking into difficult places is what we do, after all."
    #9. 
    melas "That's true, but Kron-Gantir is more dangerous than most. Generally we don't take on contracts inside the country, the reward never outweighs the risk."
    #10. 
    player "All I need is a way in, somewhere I can cross the border. I'll take care of the rest myself. With all the years it's been operating, the guild must know of a way, even if they choose not to use it."

    player_narration "Melas' eyes narrowed slightly as he studied my face. I held his gaze."

    player_narration "To assist me, Dahenwar had supplied me with a book containing instructions relating to this particular spell, and so I alternated between reading about the spell and trying – and failing – to cast it."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The relevant text was straightforward at certain points and archaic at others, and so I was struggling with some of the details."
    #8. 
    player_narration "The best I'd managed so far was one very brief twitch from the pencil I was trying to move, leading to me becoming increasingly frustrated as the lesson went on."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I knew better than to ask the Archmage for help, and asking Myrileyn would only annoy Dahenwar further."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Besides, Myrileyn was busy with her own practical work, her chosen spell involving the evaporation of water."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Like me, she had a relevant book open before her, and her attention was focused on this and the three differently-sized bowls of water placed next to the book."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I took a deep breath and once again focused my mind on my pencil, trying to channel the magical energy I possessed in the manner described within Dahenwar's book."
    #13. 
    player_narration "A minute later and all I had to show for it was an unmoved pencil and an unpleasant pulsing behind my eyes. This wasn't working, and I had a feeling that the book's instructions were to blame. It was time to improvise."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Since imagination and creative expression weren't things that Archmage Dahenwar encouraged, I knew I'd have a better chance at success with him out of the room, and so I began to hope that he'd leave on some errand at some point."
    #15. 
    player_narration "In the meantime I began writing some of my own notes, using the book's relevant text as a foundation while trying to put my own spin on it in an effort to better understand the spell."
    #16. 
    player_narration "A little while later, Dahenwar rose from his chair and, much to my delight, announced to Myrileyn and I that he had to leave the room but would return soon."

    #● Dahenwar leaves the room.
    #17. 
    player_narration "As soon as Dahenwar was gone, I read through the notes I'd written, made a couple of minor adjustments, and then focused on the pencil which lay before me."
    #18. 
    player_narration "I stared at the pencil, my breathing deep and steady as I tried to channel the spell in a slightly different way this time, one which felt simpler and more natural to me."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Several seconds passed and then a grin broke out on my face as I watched the pencil slide several inches to one side. The grin faltered, however, when I tried to move the pencil further but found myself unable to do so."
    #20. 
    player_narration "I looked at my notes again and made a few more adjustments to them based on my most recent attempt at the spell. Keeping these new thoughts in mind, I tried to move the pencil again."
    #21. 
    player_narration "This time I felt something click as I attempted to cast the spell, the channelling of the magical energy feeling much more simple and natural now, and in that instant I knew I had it."
    #22. 
    player_narration "And sure enough, the pencil on which I was so focused suddenly stood up on one end, perfectly straight, as I held it there through force of will alone. I'd done it."

    player "Yes!"
    #24. 
    myrileyn "Congratulations."
    #25.

    player_narration "Myrileyn was smiling as she looked at my pencil and then at me, her expression keen and curious."

    myrileyn "These sorcery lessons are a farce. Oh, Dahenwar has us learning the odd little spell now and again, but most of the time he's wasting our time. At the rate we're going, we'll be old and grey before we've learned a tenth of what we should."

    #10.

    player_narration "As she was closing her bag, Myrileyn chuckled sardonically, shaking her head. Then she looked at me again."
    #12. 
    myrileyn "Let's be honest, they don't deserve to be called that. All I've learned is that Dahenwar and his "teachings"have nothing to offer me."

    myrileyn "And you. Goodbye."
    #22. 
    player_narration "I turned to watch Myrileyn as she headed towards the door. She opened it, gave me a wave and one last smile, both of which I returned, and then she was gone, closing the door behind her."
    #23. 
    player_narration "I kept my eyes on the door for a moment, wondering how Myrileyn's search for an alternate education in sorcery would turn out. Then I put it from my mind and returned to my work. "

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Player-Character (PC) and Myrileyn are sitting together at a table in a quiet, private corner of the library, away from the other people scattered around it.
    #1. 
    player_narration "As ever, the city library was hushed and peaceful as Myrileyn and I walked through its front entrance and into its cavernous main room, the two of us having met up outside as planned."
    #2. 
    player_narration "We had done so several times over the past few weeks, our hours at the library spent learning about and discussing sorcery, trying to gain the knowledge that Dahenwar couldn't be bothered to teach us."
    #3. 
    player_narration "As we entered the library again, Belawen, the head librarian, was standing behind the counter and sorting through several stacks of books. "
    #4. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I exchanged polite smiles with her as we passed the counter and made our way to the small, private corner of the library which Belawen kept reserved for Myrileyn when asked in advance."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I assumed that Belawen did this simply because Myrileyn – the High Lord's daughter – asked her to."
    #6. 
    player_narration "But even if this was the primary reason, the two lyria seemed to get along well enough, even with their differing personalities, the impulsive and wilful Myrileyn standing in stark contrast to the serious and reserved Belawen."
    #7. 
    player_narration "There were a number of other people scattered around the vast library, some sitting at tables and reading their books of choice, others wandering amongst or perusing the countless bookshelves."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I walked silently to our destination, a small section tucked away in one far corner of the room, somewhere we could work in relative privacy and without disturbing anyone else."
    #9. 
    player_narration "We took our seats at a table, and Myrileyn withdrew from her bag three magic-related books which she'd borrowed from the library during our last visit, and which we were finding useful to study and discuss together."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Although the library at the Mages' Guild held many books on sorcery which were unavailable to the general public, the city library still had plenty of interesting and important texts for Myrileyn and I to choose from."
    #11. 
    player_narration "She chose one of her three books and opened it to the page we'd reached at the end of our previous session. The topic in question concerned some fundamental aspects of fire-related sorcery..."
    #12. 
    player_narration "...although at the same time, there was enough room for interpretation and innovation that it sparked our imaginations and gave us plenty to talk and theorise about."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Before we knew it, nearly an hour had passed, one which we'd filled with enthusiastic discussion. Although I'd initially had some doubts about Myrileyn's plan for us to study together, away from the Mages' Guild..."
    #14. 
    player_narration "...I had to admit that so far it had been working out well, as not only was I learning more but I was enjoying the time we spent together."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn was in the middle of a sentence when suddenly she stopped speaking and glanced around, although there was no one within view. Then she set her gaze on me and I saw a sly, confident smile form on her lips."
    #16. 
    myrileyn "Actually, I think that's enough theory for now, don't you? I say it's time we try some practical."
    #17. 
    player "What, here? Now?"
    #18. 
    myrileyn "No time like the present. And it's what we're putting in all this effort for, isn't it? To actually be able to cast these spells?"
    #19. 
    player "Yes, but we're talking about a fire spell. In a library. We're surrounded by dry, old paper and wooden bookshelves – not exactly the safest place for fire sorcery, don't you think?"
    #20. 
    myrileyn "It'll be fine. We've been working hard on this, it's all been sinking in – I know what I'm doing."
    #21. 
    player "Theory and practical are two very different things. This isn't the place."

    #26.6.
    player_narration "The small fireball vanished as quickly as it had appeared, a rising wisp of smoke being the only evidence of its brief presence. The explosion's accompanying noise must have been heard by everyone in the library, however. "#(GO TO 26.7.)

    #Location: Mages' Guild, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in a spacious room inside the Mages' Guild. Around the room are a number of bookshelves filled with books, tables with magic-related items on them,  a candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a single door, and several tall windows which let in daylight. The only two people in the room are Player-Character (PC) and Archmage Dahenwar, each of whom is sitting behind a desk.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I arrived for my latest sorcery lesson at the Mages' Guild to find Archmage Dahenwar sitting behind his desk with a satisfied expression on his face, a change from his usual cold disdain."
    #2. 
    player_narration "There were no other students in attendance, which was a shame as other students often made the time in Dahenwar's presence more tolerable."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I also couldn't help but be a little disappointed that, once again, Myrileyn wasn't present, although I shouldn't have been surprised – as far as I knew, she'd made good on her word and hadn't returned here since she gave up the lessons."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Neither Dahenwar nor I said anything as I took my seat at an empty desk. I wondered how Myrileyn's pursuit of sorcery was going. If I saw her again, I'd be sure to ask."
    #5. 
    player_narration "As I was withdrawing my books and notes from my bag, I glanced at Dahenwar to see him looking at me with that same satisfied expression. Clearly he was pleased about something."
    #6. 
    dahenwar "Pay attention, [PLAYER NAME]. There's an important lesson you can learn here today."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I couldn't help but be suspicious – Dahenwar usually kept conversation to a minimum, and when he did speak, little good ever came of it."
    #8. 
    player "What lesson is that, Archmage?"
    #9. 
    dahenwar "One about knowing your limits. It seems our would-be expert mage, the fair lady Myrileyn, was practicing sorcery with another young lyria in the city library when they had a little accident."
    #10. 
    dahenwar "Myrileyn was unharmed, but the other lyria wasn't as fortunate. She's dead."
    #11. 
    player_narration "This incident was news to me. I was shocked that something so terrible could happen at an innocuous location like the library, and worried about Myrileyn's involvement."
    #12. 
    player_narration "As for Dahenwar, although a young lyria was dead, he couldn't keep the malicious satisfaction from his face."
    #13. 
    dahenwar "Such a tragedy. But then, this is what happens when impetuous children believe they know everything and choose to ignore the instructions and wisdom of their elders. Their betters."
    #14. 
    player_narration "As disgusted as I was by Dahenwar's attitude, I suppressed it for the moment as I attempted to obtain more information from him."
    #15. 
    player "What happened, exactly? And when?"
    #16. 
    dahenwar "Yesterday afternoon, Myrileyn and her friend were apparently experimenting with fire sorcery in a corner of the library. Something went wrong, there was an explosion, and now here we are."
    #17. 
    dahenwar "Whether it was Myrileyn or the other lyria who actually caused the explosion isn't clear, but even if it wasn't her then Myrileyn remains culpable. No doubt her friend was simply following her wilful example."
    #18. 
    player "Is Myrileyn alright?"
    #19. 
    dahenwar "As I said, she's unharmed. Perhaps the experience of seeing her friend blown apart in front of her might even improve her attitude, instil some maturity in her."
    #20. 
    player_narration "I felt my hands clench into fists at Dahenwar's callousness, and I didn't care if my anger showed on my face as I stared at him."
    #21. 
    player_narration "If it did, Dahenwar was unmoved by it. Instead he leaned forward in his chair and fixed his cold gaze upon me."
    #22. 
    dahenwar "Myrileyn thought she knew it all, thought she knew better than me... and look where that has led her."
    #23. 
    dahenwar "If you have any sense, you'll learn from this. Know your place, and do as you're told. And perhaps you won't end up a smouldering corpse like that stupid lyria in the library."
    #24. 
    player_narration "It took some effort but I held my tongue. Dahenwar relaxed slightly, once again leaning back in his chair."
    #25. 
    player_narration "He turned his head to look out of one of the windows, and at this point he seemed to be talking more to himself than me. A smile of both satisfaction and anticipation lingered on his lips."
    #26. 
    dahenwar "Myrileyn won't be allowed to practice sorcery anymore, of course. Not outside of my strict supervision, anyway. I've made sure of that..."
    #27. 
    player_narration "I almost shuddered at the tone of Dahenwar's voice. Whatever Myrileyn's exact involvement in the tragic incident at the library, I pitied her for whatever she might have to endure if she was placed under Dahenwar's control. "

    #19. 
    myrileyn "And of course, there's only so much I can say in return because he's not coming right out and saying these things. But he might as well be, and everyone knows it. Even my father, not that he cares."

    player_narration "Myrileyn wasn't looking at me, but I had my eyes on her – as she spoke, I watched her anxiety gradually transform into anger, her expression hardening, her hands clenching into fists as they rested on the table."

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Player-Character (PC) and Myrileyn are sitting together at a table in a quiet, private corner of the library, away from the other people scattered around it.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I sat in our usual quiet corner of the city library, having met up for another study session, a couple of sorcery-related books laying open on our table."
    #2. 
    player_narration "About half-an-hour had passed and we were currently reading in silence, each of us occupied with a different book."
    #3. 
    player_narration "My attention was focused on the page before me, but when Myrileyn placed a hand on my nearest forearm, I raised my head to look over at her."
    #4. 
    player_narration "She was leaning back in her chair, her head turned to one side as she looked off across the library, at something currently out of sight to me, my view obstructed by a nearby set of bookshelves."
    #5. 
    player "What is it?"
    #6. 
    myrileyn "Look, quickly. It's him."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I remained in my seat but leaned to see past the obstructing bookshelves and in the direction Myrileyn was looking."
    #8. 
    player_narration "At first I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be looking at, as all I could see were more shelves, more books, more tables, and a few scattered people."
    #9. 
    player_narration "But then one of those people turned slightly, giving me a better look at their face, and I saw that it was Archmage Dahenwar."
    #10. 
    player_narration "He was standing before a set of bookshelves, his eyes roaming across its numerous volumes. Rather than removing any of the books, however, instead he was writing in a notebook."
    #11. 
    player_narration "He held the notebook before him at chest-height, his gaze alternating between it and the shelves. He didn't seem to have noticed Myrileyn and I."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I sat back in my chair, once again losing sight of Dahenwar. Myrileyn did the same, removing her hand from my forearm. She looked at me with a keen expression."
    #13. 
    myrileyn "Did you see it?"
    #14. 
    player "I saw Dahenwar, if that's what you mean."
    #15. 
    myrileyn "I'm talking about the notebook, the one he was writing in – did you see it?"
    #16. 
    player "Yes. And...?"
    #17. 
    myrileyn "I've seen him writing in that same notebook at the Mages' Guild, during class, and once in his office. I think I even saw him with it at the palace once, and now he's carrying it around with him here as well."
    #18. 
    player "Alright, so he uses it often."
    #19. 
    myrileyn "Exactly. What if he's writing important things in it? Information he'd like to keep private?"
    #20. 
    myrileyn "When I saw him using it in his office, I saw where he kept it – in a drawer in his desk. One he locked after putting the notebook in there. Don't you find that a little suspicious?"
    #21. 
    player "Not especially. Listen, what are you saying?"
    #22. 
    myrileyn "I want to steal that notebook. If I can get my hands on it, even if only temporarily, I can find out what Dahenwar is hiding in there."
    #23. 
    player "...This is about your aunt, isn't it."
    #24. 
    myrileyn "...Yes. You know how certain I am of Dahenwar having something to do with her disappearance. If there's a chance that notebook might offer me any clues... I have to take it."
    #25. 
    player "He could be writing anything – lesson plans, sorcery notes, everyday reminders, any manner of guild or Archmage business..."
    #26. 
    player "You may be the High Lord's daughter, but what you're suggesting could be very dangerous, Myrileyn. Especially if Dahenwar is as ruthless as you say he is."
    #27. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn's expression set in a stubborn frown as she looked at me, and I knew there'd be no changing her mind."
    #28. 
    myrileyn "I'm going to see what's in that notebook. I'll go to his office at the Mages' Guild and break into the drawer where he keeps it."
    #29. 
    myrileyn "You can help me if you like. If not then I'll just have to do it alone."

    PART A

    #Location: Mages' Guild, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are in Dahenwar's private office at the Mages' Guild. Several large windows let in illusory daylight. The room contains a desk, a chair and several sets of bookshelves. Player-Character (PC) and Myrileyn enter the room. Archmage Dahenwar isn't present.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Treading carefully and quietly, Myrileyn and I crept along the hallway until we arrived at the door of Archmage Dahenwar's private office. The Mages' Guild was even quieter at night than it was during the day..."
    #2. 
    player_narration "...but we knew we weren't alone in the building, so we moved stealthily. We weren't supposed to be here, after all."
    #3. 
    player_narration "We'd met up a couple of hours after sunset, on a quiet street near the Mages' Guild. As usual our goal was the pursuit of knowledge, although sorcery wasn't our focus this time."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Rather, it was whatever knowledge might be contained within the pages of Dahenwar's notebook, which would hopefully be found inside the desk drawer where Myrileyn claimed he kept it."
    #5. 
    player_narration "The two of us had entered the Mages' Guild via a rear window after causing a small distraction at the front door, one which occupied the attention of the elderly servant on duty as we snuck inside."
    #6. 
    player_narration "We'd made our way up to the top floor and Dahenwar's office without seeing anyone else along the way, although at one point we did hear a couple of muffled voices coming from some distant room."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Although we weren't spotted by anything living, I couldn't help but wonder if there were any spells in place whose purpose was to detect or deter intruders. But I'd put the thought aside and pressed on."
    #8. 
    player_narration "As we stood before the door, I turned to look at Myrileyn. Her nervous excitement was clear, but she was determined as well – I knew how set she was on finding out what happened to her aunt."
    #9. 
    player_narration "We listened in silence for a few seconds, but no sounds came from behind the door. I grasped the handle and turned it gently, slightly surprised to discover that it wasn't locked."
    #10. 
    player_narration "A quick scan of the room confirmed it to be empty. My fellow trespasser and I stepped inside and I closed the door behind us..."
    #11. 
    player_narration "...only to be startled and confused when the dark room, which had been illuminated only by moonlight just an instant before, suddenly filled with sunlight."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I winced, the unexpected brightness stinging my eyes. I blinked several times, my vision affected but still sufficiently clear to see that, sure enough, sunlight was streaming in through the windows."
    #13. 
    player_narration "I turned towards Myrileyn, who smiled at my obvious confusion."
    #14. 
    myrileyn "It's an illusion. An illumination spell dressed up to give it the appearance of natural daylight. I've seen it before. It must be set to automatically trigger whenever anyone enters the room."
    #15. 
    player "Hence my singed eyeballs, then."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn wasn't listening, her attention was already focused on Dahenwar's desk. She walked over to it, and I followed."
    #17. 
    player_narration "We stood before the desk, specifically one of its drawers. Myrileyn tugged at the handle, but as expected, it was locked."
    #18. 
    player_narration "She slipped a hand into one of her pockets and withdrew a lockpick. She squatted before the drawer, leaning close to it and staring at it intently as she inserted the lockpick into the keyhole and began turning it this way and that."
    #19. 
    player_narration "I stood next to her, my eyes moving between the desk drawer and the door, half-expecting the latter to suddenly open at any second."
    #20. 
    player_narration "After about a minute, Myrileyn was losing patience – her movements with the lockpick were becoming rougher and agitated, and she cursed several times."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Well aware that every second we spent in the Mages' Guild was another second in which we might be discovered, I squatted next to Myrileyn and looked at her."
    #22. 
    player "Let me try."
    #23. 
    player_narration "With an annoyed frown, Myrileyn nodded and released her grip on the lockpick, which remained in the keyhole. She stood up as I took over from her."
    #"(IF LOCK-PICKING STAT IS BELOW REQUIRED AMOUNT, GO TO 24.1.)"
    #"(IF LOCK-PICKING STAT IS HIGH ENOUGH, GO TO 25.1.)"

    #24.1.
    player_narration "I tried to make my hand movements as steady and gentle as possible as I moved the lockpick around inside the keyhole, hoping to feel the lock releasing, but meeting nothing but resistance. "#(GO TO 24.2.)
    #24.2.
    player_narration "Several minutes passed like this, and I could feel not only Myrileyn's patience wearing thin but also my own tension increasing as I kept expecting Dahenwar or someone else to stroll in through the door. "#(GO TO 24.3.)
    #24.3.

    #24.21.

    #Location: High Lord's Palace, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the High Lord's Palace, specifically the private chambers of Archmage Dahenwar. It is night, the scene illuminated by moonlight.

    player_narration "Hours later, night had fallen and now here I was, a trespasser on the grounds of the High Lord's Palace, quietly rifling through a cabinet in Archmage Dahenwar's bedroom as he slept just a few feet away from me... "#(GO TO 2.2.)
    #2.2.
    player_narration "...and all because Myrileyn so desperately wanted to get her hands on the notebook which Dahenwar possessed. "#(GO TO 2.3.)
    #2.3.
    player_narration "My infiltration had begun when she met me at a small gate at the rear of the palace grounds, helping me gain access before guiding me through the darkness to the wing which contained Dahenwar's fifth-floor chambers. "#(GO TO 2.4.)
    #2.4.
    player_narration "We'd stopped at a door which led inside the building and I told Myrileyn I'd be handling the rest alone, that she should go back to her rooms so as not to arouse suspicion. "#(GO TO 2.5.)
    #2.5.
    player_narration "She'd protested, but I insisted that I could rely on my own stealth from that point on, and that she would only slow me down and increase the odds of me being discovered. "#(GO TO 2.6.)
    #2.6.
    player_narration "Eventually she'd agreed. She wished me luck and walked off into the darkness, moving in the direction of the main part of the palace. "#(GO TO 2.7.)
    #2.7.
    player_narration "I'd turned towards the door at which I stood, quickly picked the lock, and slipped inside, closing the door behind me. "#(GO TO 2.8.)
    #2.8.
    player_narration "I was in a short corridor which had a couple of doors leading off it. I paused and listened, but heard nothing. Given that there were still several floors between myself and the Archmage's chambers, I knew that didn't count for much. "#(GO TO 2.9.)
    #2.9.
    player_narration "Moving in a half-crouch, I'd made my way through numerous corridors and rooms. The palace interior was clean and finely decorated. Lamps burned in places while other areas were either pitch-black or dimly illuminated by moonlight. "#(GO TO 2.10.)
    #2.10.
    player_narration "I'd stuck to the darkness as much as possible, gradually making my way upwards through the building. I heard a few scattered voices as I went, and was careful to keep my distance from their owners. "#(GO TO 2.11.)
    #2.11.
    player_narration "Eventually I'd reached the fifth floor and the door which Myrileyn had told me about, one of two which led into Dahenwar's chambers. This one stood in a less open spot than the main entrance, so was better suited to my purpose. "#(GO TO 2.12.)
    #2.12.
    player_narration "Within a few seconds I'd picked the lock of the door and was inside the Archmage's chambers. I closed the door behind me in silence. "#(GO TO 2.13.)
    #2.13.
    player_narration "Myrileyn had told me that the chambers consisted of two bedrooms, a bathroom, a dining room, a study, a small lobby, and a lounge. "#(GO TO 2.14.)
    #2.14.
    player_narration "It was the dining room in which I found myself, as evidenced by the long dining table of thick, polished wood which dominated the room, the table surrounded by a number of ornately carved chairs. "#(GO TO 2.15.)
    #2.15.
    player_narration "The room's only light source was some faint moonlight, but my eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness by this point. I listened for any sounds coming from elsewhere within the chambers, but heard nothing. "#(GO TO 2.16.)
    #2.16.
    player_narration "I didn't relax, however – as late as the hour was, I knew there was a chance that the Archmage might be awake, and that could be a real problem. "#(GO TO 2.17.)
    #2.17.
    player_narration "I'd soon find out one way or another, as the main bedroom was the first room I intended to search for the notebook. Dahenwar liked to keep the notebook close, after all. Failing that, my next stop would be the study. "#(GO TO 2.18.)
    #2.18.
    player_narration "And so I'd crept out of the dining room and into the adjoining lobby. Still darkness, still silence. "#(GO TO 2.19.)
    #2.19.
    player_narration "I'd tried one of the lobby's other doors, opening it just enough to hear light, rhythmic snoring coming from the darkened room beyond. I stepped into the room and looked around to see what I could make out in the gloom. "#(GO TO 2.20.)
    #2.20.
    player_narration "It was a bedroom, large and exquisitely furnished. In the spacious four-poster bed, someone lay snoring beneath some thick blankets. I'd tiptoed closer to the bed to get a clearer look at the source of the snoring... "#(GO TO 2.21.)
    #2.21.
    player_narration "...and sure enough, there he was: Dahenwar. The Archmage looked less cold and intimidating than usual, what with his mouth hanging open and some strands of hair lying across his face. "#(GO TO 2.22.)
    #2.22.
    player_narration "I'd dreaded to think of what Myrileyn might have been tempted to drop into that open mouth. "#(GO TO 2.23.)
    #2.23.
    player_narration "  My attention had turned to a wooden cabinet which stood next to one side of the wide bed. It held several locked drawers, and I focused on the topmost one as I withdrew my lockpick from my pocket. "#(GO TO 2.24.)
    #2.24.
    player_narration "A few seconds later and now here I was, my hands rooting through the private possessions of one of the most powerful lyrians in the country as he slept nearby. "#(GO TO 2.25.)
    #2.25.
    player_narration "Despite the danger, I focused on the task at hand, the topmost drawer turning out to hold nothing but some Mages' Guild documents and writing utensils. "#(GO TO 2.26.)
    #2.26.
    player_narration "Moving on to the drawer below it, I picked the lock, opened it, and couldn't help a small grin appearing briefly on my face as I saw the single item contained within: Dahenwar's notebook. "#(GO TO 2.27.)
    #2.27.
    player_narration "I withdrew the notebook and quietly closed the drawer before locking it once again. I took one last look at the Archmage, who was still sleeping soundly, and then crept from the bedroom and back out into the lobby. "#(GO TO 2.28.)
    #2.28.
    player_narration "Within ten minutes I was back outside in the cool night air. I left the palace grounds via the same gate by which I'd entered. "#(GO TO 2.29.)
    #2.29.
    player_narration "I felt the weight of the notebook in my pocket and thought about how thrilled Myrileyn would be when I handed it over to her the next time we met. I'd taken a risk tonight, certainly... "#(GO TO 2.30.)
    #2.30.

    #3.11.
    player_narration "We came to the spot above the window which was to be my entry point. A chimney jutted out of the roof nearby, and lying next to it, one end already tied and knotted around the chimney, was a length of thick, wiry rope. "#(GO TO 3.12.)
    #3.12.
    player_narration "Myrileyn had tied the other end around my waist, tight enough that it dug in uncomfortably, but discomfort was preferable to a five-storey fall. "#(GO TO 3.13.)
    #3.13.
    player_narration "She'd grasped the rope tightly in both hands as I moved over to the edge of the roof and knelt down. We looked at each other, nodded, and then I took a deep breath and began carefully lowering myself over the edge. "#(GO TO 3.14.)
    #3.14.

    #3.16.
    player_narration "The stone was cold and unyielding as I pressed myself tightly against it and inched my way downwards, my clothes fluttering in the breeze which blew around me. "#(GO TO 3.17.)
    #3.17.
    player_narration "I felt naked and far too visible up there, high on the wall of the palace, as if I might look down and see the entire population of Lyr-Taer looking up at me with accusing stares... "#(GO TO 3.18.)

    #3.20.
    player_narration "As I moved my other foot down to the same spot, however, my first foot slipped, my stomach lurching as I suddenly found myself falling past the window, my fingers instinctively scrabbling at whatever surface they could grab onto. "#(GO TO 3.21.)
    #3.21.

    #● Player-Character (PC) is lying in bed, his leg broken after the fall of the previous night. Myrileyn is sitting in a chair at his bedside, facing him. The room is illuminated by daylight.

    #6. 
    player_narration "As the memories became clear, so too did the source of most of my pain – although I ached all over, it was my left leg which hurt more than anything else."
    #7. 
    player_narration "As she saw me waking up, an expression of relief appeared on Myrileyn's face. She leaned in towards me and hugged me fiercely, enough to make me wince due to how tender and bruised I felt."

    #15. 
    player "Like I fell off a building. My leg..."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn looked down, although I could see enough of her face to see the troubled expression on it."
    #17. 
    myrileyn "You broke it in the fall. You've got some nasty cuts and bruises but your leg is the worst of it. Nothing permanent, though – the doctor says it should be all healed up within a few weeks."
    #18. 
    player "You brought me home."
    #19. 
    myrileyn "I rushed down to you, you were already unconscious. I managed to hide you in some nearby bushes, and then I went to find one of the palace guards and asked him to help me bring you here."
    #20. 
    myrileyn "Don't worry, I've known him all my life – I trust him. He won't say anything about you to my father or anyone else."
    #21. 
    myrileyn "After that, I summoned a doctor I know. I told him you were my friend and that you'd had an accident, nothing more than that. He set your broken leg and took care of your other injuries as well."
    #22. 
    myrileyn "That was yesterday, you've been asleep since then."
    #23. 
    player "Have you been here the whole time?"

    #25. 
    myrileyn "I had to stay. I couldn't leave you, not when... when this is all my fault."
    #26. 
    myrileyn "I thought that rope was strong enough, I don't know why it..."
    #27. 
    myrileyn "That fall could've killed you, [PLAYER NAME]. I know no apology is good enough, but I'm so, so sorry about what happened, please believe me."

    myrileyn "If it had been worse, I don't know what I would've..."
    #29. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn's voice trailed off. I squeezed her hands and gave her as much of a smile as I could manage."
    #30. 
    player "It's alright. You didn't force me onto that roof, it was my decision. You don't need to be upset."
    #31. 
    player "I'm sorry I couldn't get Dahenwar's notebook for you."
    #32. 
    player_narration "Keeping one of her hands on mine, Myrileyn used her other hand to wipe at a corner of one of her eyes, her tears threatening to spill forth."
    #33. 
    myrileyn "You've got nothing to apologise for. As I said, this is all my fault."
    #34. 
    player "What are you going to do about it now? The notebook, I mean."
    #35. 
    myrileyn "I still intend to find out what happened to my aunt, but... this mess you're in, what I've done to you, it's made me realise how selfish I've been."
    #36. 
    myrileyn "I had no right to ask you or anyone else to take the kind of risk you did, and all for what could turn out to be nothing. I was too wrapped up in what I wanted to worry about what might happen to anyone else. But when I saw you fall..."
    #37. 
    myrileyn "If I start using people and putting them at risk just to suit myself, that makes me no better than Dahenwar. And I am not like him."

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Player-Character (PC) and Myrileyn are sitting together at a table in a quiet, private corner of the library, away from the other people scattered around it.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I once again met at the city library, occupying our usual table in a quiet corner of the ground floor, away from any prying ears and eyes."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Although our usual reason for spending time together at the library was our ongoing study of sorcery, today was different."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Today was all about Archmage Dahenwar's notebook, which I knew Myrileyn had been poring over since she got her hands on it. She'd contacted me yesterday and asked me to meet her today to discuss what she'd found."
    #4. 
    player_narration "She was already sitting at our table when I arrived, a few of her sorcery books set out before her, although I assumed this was just for show."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I took a seat and placed on the table before me a couple of my own sorcery books, as well as some paper and writing utensils. Myrileyn looked around warily but there was no one nearby."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Even so, I kept my voice a little lower than normal as I spoke."
    #7. 
    player "So, was it worth the trouble?"
    #8. 
    player_narration "Following my lead, Myrileyn spoke at a slightly lower volume as well."
    #9. 
    myrileyn "Were you followed here?"
    #10. 
    player "Not as far as I know. Why? Does Dahenwar know anything?"
    #11. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I had both recently spent time with the Archmage due to our sorcery lessons at the Mages' Guild..."
    #12. 
    player_narration "...and while Dahenwar had been even more impatient and acid-tongued than usual since the theft of his notebook, as far as I knew he suspected neither Myrileyn nor myself of the crime."
    #13. 
    myrileyn "I don't think so. I suppose I'm just being cautious."
    #14. 
    player "That's a first for you."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn gave me a playful slap on my nearest arm, the two of us smiling."
    #16. 
    player "So, the notebook?"
    #17. 
    myrileyn "Well, I can tell you that it didn't reveal some softer, kinder, well-hidden side of Dahenwar – the lyrian's just as much of an arse in print as he is in the flesh."
    #18. 
    myrileyn "The notebook is mostly a sort of journal, mixed in with notes about the Mages' Guild, Archmage business, politics, certain nobles and other figures, and details of various aspects of city business. He definitely likes to cast his web over a wide area."
    #19. 
    myrileyn "It dates back a few years, he doesn't write journal entries every day. And most of the entries he does write tend to be just him complaining about or criticising one thing or another."
    #20. 
    myrileyn "He rants about my father, other nobles and politicians, the Mages' Guild and other organisations, the city guard, the people on his own staff, other races... it goes on and on."
    #21. 
    myrileyn "And of course, his frustration seems to come from the fact that not enough people simply do as he says, that only he knows what's best but other people's incompetence keeps getting in his way."
    #22. 
    myrileyn "I mean, I always knew he was arrogant, but honestly, the hubris on display in this notebook... even if I didn't already know him it would make me angry."
    #23. 
    player "Does he mention anything about you?"
    #24. 
    player_narration "An annoyed frown appeared on Myrileyn's face, giving me my answer."
    #25. 
    myrileyn "Oh, he writes a few times about "the brat"or "the spoilt little princess."There are a few other, less polite, descriptions of me as well."
    #26. 
    myrileyn "He doesn't seem to give me all that much thought, though. I don't think he considers me any kind of real threat, just another annoyance for him to deal with."
    #27. 
    player "You said the notebook dates back a few years, but your aunt's been missing longer than that, right? Does that mean there's nothing about her in there?"
    #28. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn's disappointment was clear as she looked down at the table."
    #29. 
    myrileyn "...No. There's nothing written about her."
    #30. 
    player "That's a shame. I'm sorry to hear that."
    #31. 
    myrileyn "There was one thing that caught my eye, though..."
    #32. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn reached underneath the table and picked up her bag, from which she withdrew Dahenwar's notebook, keeping it in her lap rather than placing it on the table and in plain sight."
    #33. 
    player_narration "She returned her bag to the floor at her feet and opened the notebook, flipping through a few pages before she found what she was looking for."
    #34. 
    myrileyn "Here it is: something Dahenwar wrote not too long ago by the looks of it, although this passage isn't dated, so I couldn't say exactly when."
    #35. 
    myrileyn ""Once again my lyrians discover Kiaris in a place which I have forbidden him to visit. I dislike having to repeat myself to anyone, and my son is no exception.""
    #36. 
    myrileyn ""He is growing increasingly wilful as time passes, and it causes me concern. It is a pity he cannot see that I am doing this partly for his sake.""
    #37. 
    myrileyn ""I punished him, more severely than the first time, but I could see by the look on his face that this would only dissuade him for so long. Perhaps I should take stricter measures to cure him of his curiosity and stubbornness.""
    #38. 
    myrileyn ""Because one thing is certain: if he continues down this path, he will inevitably draw attention, and I have worked too long and hard for his foolishness to compromise me now.""
    #39. 
    myrileyn "The passage stops there."

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. There are a number of customers sitting or standing around the room, eating, drinking and talking, some alone and others in pairs of larger groups. The owner, Yandar, is behind the counter, serving customers. Player-Character (PC) and Myrileyn sit together at a table in a corner of the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I stepped through the front door and into the Golden Meadow Inn, the warm, well-lit room within a haven from the darkness and pouring rain outside."
    #2. 
    player_narration "We'd met up on a nearby street before making our way to the inn, and now our cloaks were soaked from the downpour."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I lowered my hood while Myrileyn kept hers up, obscuring much of her face – we didn't want to draw any unnecessary attention, and revealing her identity as High Lord Tialas' daughter would do just that."
    #4. 
    player_narration "The Golden Meadow was busy, with people sitting at tables or at the counter, drinking and talking. Yandar was behind the counter, pouring drinks while chatting to a waiting customer."
    #5. 
    player_narration "We'd come here with the goal of hiring a professional to stalk Archmage Dahenwar's son, Kiaris. Myrileyn had discreetly consulted some sources about where we might find such a person, and later told me our destination."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Far from being a dark, stinking, back-alley tavern full of cutthroats, the Golden Meadow was a clean and respectable inn..."
    #7. 
    player_narration "...but it was also a place that catered to a varied crowd, with the occasional shady character mixed in amongst the law-abiding citizens. And after all, we wanted a professional, not some common thug likely to stab us in the back."
    #8. 
    player_narration "We weren't looking for an assassin, just someone who could be very discreet, regularly keeping an eye on Kiaris' activities and movements without being spotted themselves."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and I crossed the room to the counter and waited for Yandar as he finished up with his current customer. Soon enough he came over to me with a cheerful smile on his lips."
    #10. 
    yandar "Evening, [PLAYER NAME]."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Yandar's eyes then moved to Myrileyn, whereupon they widened slightly and the smile disappeared from his face, his expression turning to one of surprise."
    #12. 
    yandar "Lady Myrileyn, I didn't – "
    #13. 
    player_narration "So much for the disguise, I thought as Myrileyn leaned in towards Yandar and, keeping her voice low, snapped at him in annoyance."
    #14. 
    myrileyn "Keep it down! I'm in disguise!"
    #15. 
    player_narration "Yandar paused before eventually whispering a reply with a small, puzzled frown on his face."
    #16. 
    yandar "My apologies."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Yandar returned his attention to me, pointedly ignoring Myrileyn from that point on, his former cheerful smile returning as he pretended that the High Lord's daughter wasn't standing before him."
    #18. 
    yandar "So, [PLAYER NAME], what can I get you?"
    #19. 
    player_narration "Speaking normally, I asked for two mugs of ale, then I lowered my voice so as not to be overheard."
    #20. 
    player "We need somebody followed, and we're looking to hire a professional to do the following, someone who can be stealthy and discreet. I was wondering if you could spread the word to any suitable people you might know."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Yandar nodded as he poured two ales and handed them to me."
    #22. 
    yandar "I might be able to help. If you hang around for a little while, I'll see what I can do."
    #23. 
    player_narration "I thanked Yandar, took the two mugs and then led Myrileyn to a small table in a quiet corner of the room. We each took a seat and waited, infrequently sipping at our ales and speaking little."
    #24. 
    player_narration "We received the occasional glance from some of the other customers, but no more than that. Eventually, however, a lyrian emerged from the crowd and, saying nothing, took a seat at our table."
    #25. 
    player_narration "We regarded him in silence. He appeared fairly youthful but gave the impression of being older and more experienced than he looked. He wore a cloak over his other clothes, and like Myrileyn, kept his hood up."
    #26. 
    player_narration "His eyes moved from me to Myrileyn and then back to me again, his expression calm and businesslike as I held his gaze."
    #27. 
    melas "Yandar says you want someone followed."
    #28. 
    player "Do you have experience with that kind of thing?"
    #29. 
    melas "Many years' worth. Who's the target?"
    #30. 
    player "...His name is Kiaris. He's the son of Archmage Dahenwar."
    #31. 
    player_narration "The stranger frowned thoughtfully for a moment."
    #32. 
    melas "How long do you want him followed?"
    #33.

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. There are a number of customers sitting or standing around the room, eating, drinking and talking, some alone and others in pairs of larger groups. The owner, Yandar, is behind the counter, serving customers. Player-Character (PC) is sitting at a table with Melas.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I sat at a corner table in the Golden Meadow Inn, a half-empty mug of ale before me. My companion, Melas, the lyrian hired to watch Kiaris, wasn't drinking."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd arranged to meet him here tonight to receive his first report. I came alone – Myrileyn had desperately wanted to join me but was unable to, although the plan was for me to pass on Melas' findings to her the next time we met up."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Melas and I had shared no words of greeting as he joined me at my table, one far enough away from the majority of the crowd that our conversation should remain private."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Now he fixed his cool gaze on me and I looked back, waiting for him to break the silence."
    #5. 
    melas "Kiaris doesn't spend much time alone. He's often accompanied by a small crowd of sycophants, other nobles of dubious reputation. They spend most of their time roaming Lyr-Taer's more exclusive drinking establishments and restaurants."
    #6. 
    melas "There are also a couple of young lyria with whom he seems to be having liaisons."
    #7. 
    melas "Kiaris behaves like an ass to almost everyone but of course people let him get away with it, they know who his father is."
    #8. 
    player "It sounds like you've got nothing significant to report, then."
    #9. 
    melas "There was one thing of note."
    #10. 
    melas "Early one morning last week, Kiaris went alone to the industrial district. It was odd because he very rarely rises early, and the industrial district wasn't somewhere I'd seen him visit before then."
    #11. 
    melas "He stopped in a small courtyard, a private, quiet spot. He was waiting for someone."
    #12. 
    melas "About ten minutes later, a group of three men arrived. I hadn't seen Kiaris associate with humans before. Not only that, but these men were far from nobles or wealthy socialites."
    #13. 
    melas "They were armed, for one, but it was also the way they looked, the way they carried themselves – they were fighters, killers. Mercenaries, if I had to guess."
    #14. 
    player "What business did Kiaris have with a group of human mercenaries?"
    #15. 
    melas "I'm not sure. From my position I couldn't hear everything they said, but I managed to make out a few snatches of their conversation."
    #16. 
    melas "Kiaris reminded the men who he was, he seemed to want something from them but they wouldn't cooperate. The human who acted like the leader of the group said they didn't take orders from Kiaris..."
    #17. 
    melas "...and then he mentioned something about Archmage Dahenwar, but I didn't catch what it was exactly. Kiaris obviously didn't like what he was hearing, he became more annoyed and impatient as they spoke. The humans didn't seem to care."
    #18. 
    melas "Eventually Kiaris and the men went their separate ways. I decided to follow the latter. I thought it might shed some light on their connection to Kiaris, and you hired me to learn as much as possible, after all."
    #19.

    PART A

    #Location: High Lord's Palace Gardens, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the gardens of the High Lord's Palace. It is sometime during the day and the sun is shining.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I stood alone on a spacious lawn in the gardens of the High Lord's Palace, the guard who'd led me to this spot from the main gate having left moments before."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Yesterday I'd received a message from Myrileyn, asking me to meet her at the palace."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I hadn't seen her since I'd asked High Lord Tialas for his permission to court her, and part of me wondered if I'd overstepped my bounds."
    #4. 
    player_narration "But either way it was too late now, so rather than worry about it I simply waited for Myrileyn while looking around and appreciating the splendour of the gardens."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Eventually I heard the sound of oncoming footsteps and turned to see Myrileyn appear from around a hedgerow and walk in my direction. I gave her a small wave and we smiled at each other."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn was carrying a wicker basket before her in both hands, and when she got to within a few feet of me, she placed it on the ground."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Then, to my surprise, she suddenly rushed forward and threw her arms around my neck, grabbing me in a tight embrace and pressing the side of her face against mine."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I'd been hoping for a warm welcome but this was more than I'd expected. Not wanting to spoil the moment, I said nothing as I placed my arms around Myrileyn's waist, appreciating the feel of her against me."
    #9. 
    myrileyn "Thank you. Thank you so, so much."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn spoke in an emotional, whispered tone, and for a moment I wondered what she was thanking me for. Then it hit me: Alirienne. I hadn't seen Myrileyn since I'd rescued her aunt."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Although we continued to hold each other, Myrileyn pulled her head back, her eyes glistening slightly as she looked at me with a grateful expression."
    #12. 
    myrileyn "You saved her. After all this time, I finally have her back... thanks to you."
    #13. 
    player "I'm just glad I could help."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn nodded before leaning in and kissing me softly on the cheek. Then she withdrew her arms from around my neck and took a step backwards as I lowered my own arms."
    #15. 
    myrileyn "Right, that's enough of that. Now I can go back to being mad at you for the rest of our date."
    #16. 
    player "So this is a date?"
    #17. 
    myrileyn "You tell me. You're the one who declared your undying love for me to my father, before saying a word of any of this to me."
    #18. 
    player "I don't think it was quite "undying love"... but alright. That's why you're mad at me, then."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn walked over to her basket, leant down, opened the lid and withdrew a blanket which she then spread out on the grass next to us. She sat on the blanket and looked up at me."
    #20. 
    myrileyn "Well, why don't you sit down and you can start telling me to my face how wonderful I am. Maybe that will help me forgive you."
    #21. 
    player "You're the High Lord's daughter, don't you employ people to do that?"
    #22. 
    myrileyn "No, but one type of people we do employ..."
    #23. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn tilted the open basket towards me, revealing its contents: a selection of delicious-looking pies, tarts and a few other foods."
    #24. 
    myrileyn "...is very talented cooks."
    #25. 
    player_narration "I sat down on the blanket, facing Myrileyn, who reached into the basket and brought out several plates. I watched her as she proceeded to cover the plates with a number of the foods she'd shown me."
    #26. 
    player_narration "From somewhere deeper within the basket she withdrew a bottle of wine and a pair of glasses, which she filled."
    #27. 
    player "This all looks fantastic. So you invited me here for a picnic?"
    #28. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn picked up a glass of wine and a plate of food, and held them out to me. I reached over to take them from her, at which point she pulled them away, a playful smile on her lips."
    #29. 
    myrileyn "Hmm, actually, perhaps you should just sit there and watch me enjoy all of this. Although I might be willing to share... if you provided me with some answers first."
    #30. 
    player "Answers to what?"
    #31. 
    myrileyn "Why don't we start with why I had to find out from my father – via a wonderfully awkward conversation, thank you so much for that – that you had romantic feelings for me."
    #32. 
    player_narration "I sighed and offered Myrileyn an embarrassed smile."
    #33. 
    player "I'm sorry, I know it must've come as a surprise. But I didn't have time to think it through beforehand, and your father was standing right in front of me, asking what I wanted. It was an opportunity I didn't want to waste."
    #34. 
    myrileyn "You weren't worried about what his reaction might be?"
    #35. 
    player "Well, I assumed he wouldn't be thrilled with my request... but as I said, I didn't want to waste the opportunity."
    #36. 
    myrileyn "He wasn't happy when he spoke to me about it, I can only imagine the look on his face when you told him you wanted to corrupt his young, innocent daughter."
    #37. 
    player "I didn't put it in quite those words. But no, he didn't like the idea. Luckily for me, your aunt was there, and she helped."
    #38. 
    myrileyn "What did she say?"
    #39. 
    player "She said you deserve someone who makes you happy."
    #40. 
    myrileyn "And is that what you intend to do? Make me happy?"
    #41. 
    player "I'd like to try."
    #42. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn stared into my eyes for a long moment, and I held her gaze. Then she once again held out to me the plate of food and glass of wine she'd been holding, an expression of exaggerated haughtiness on her face."
    #43. 
    myrileyn "Your answers please me, peasant. I will allow you to attempt to make me happy. Take this food and wine as a sign of my approval."
    #44. 
    player_narration "Grinning, I took what was offered. Myrileyn reached for her own glass of wine."
    #45. 
    player "Thank you. Although enough with the "peasant"talk, if you don't mind – I'm sure I'll hear enough of that from your father if I meet him again."
    #46. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn turned back to me, grinning herself now. She raised her glass in a toast, and I tapped hers with my own."
    #47. 
    player "Cheers. What are we toasting?"
    #48. 
    myrileyn "Our first date, of course."
    #49. 
    player "So this is a date, then. I'll drink to that."
    #50. 
    player_narration "We each took a swallow of wine then smiled at each other over our glasses. Then we got stuck into the plates of food, and everything tasted as good as it looked. Myrileyn was right, they did employ very talented cooks."

    #51.2.
    player_narration "But then Myrileyn's eyes suddenly focused on something over my shoulder, something which caused the smile to disappear from her lips and her brow to furrow in annoyance. "#(GO TO 51.3.)
    #51.3.
    player_narration "I turned my head to look behind me, following Myrileyn's gaze, and I immediately saw what had caught her eye. Or rather, who: her father, High Lord Tialas. "#(GO TO 51.4.)
    #51.4.
    player_narration "Tialas was about forty feet away from where we sat on the grass, ambling slowly – very slowly – along a gravel path which ran alongside a tall, flowering hedgerow. "#(GO TO 51.5.)
    #51.5.
    player_narration "He kept stopping to inspect the hedgerow's flowers, apparently taking great interest in them while occasionally casting a suspicious glance in our direction. "#(GO TO 51.6.)
    #51.6.
    player_narration "For someone who I'm sure was very good at politics, in this particular case he wasn't exactly hiding his true intentions well – he didn't care about the flowers, he'd come to see what Myrileyn and I were up to. "#(GO TO 51.7.)
    #51.7.
    player_narration "Even though Tialas made no move to approach us, I still rose to my feet, turned my body in his direction and gave a single nod of my head as a gesture of acknowledgement. He gave no sign that he'd noticed. "#(GO TO 51.8.)
    #51.8.

    #Location: High Lord's Palace Ballroom, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are in the ballroom of the High Lord's Palace. The room is vast and extravagantly decorated, much of it being taken up by a large, polished dance-floor. Long tables covered in food and drink line the walls. The room is illuminated by several large candle chandeliers, a number of candelabras on the tables, and some wall-mounted lanterns. Hundreds of people – mostly wealthy and powerful lyris, but also some guards and servants – fill the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Having shown my invitation at the main entrance and then been guided into the High Lord's Palace, I came to a stop inside the ballroom where the evening's event was taking place."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The room was vast and extravagantly decorated, and although the darkness of the night outside could be seen through the numerous tall windows, the interior was brilliantly illuminated by lanterns, candles and chandeliers."
    #3. 
    player_narration "What seemed to be a few hundred people filled the room, the crowd composed of our nation's wealthiest and most powerful lyris."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Some couples were dancing, gliding across the spacious, polished dance-floor, while other people talked in groups, sipped at glasses of wine and sampled some of the expensive foods available."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Some smartly uniformed guards stood watch in a few positions around the edges of the ballroom, while a number of servants roamed the room with trays of food and drink."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Also, in one corner of the room was a slightly raised stage, and on this stood a group of musicians playing some fittingly elegant music which mixed in with the general hum of conversation filling the room."
    #7. 
    player_narration "All in all, it wasn't the kind of gathering I was used to, but Myrileyn had asked me to attend, and so here I was."
    #8. 
    player_narration "As a drink-carrying servant passed nearby, I eagerly took a glass of wine from his tray and then took a long swallow as my eyes roamed across the sea of faces, nearly all unfamiliar to me."

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Player-Character (PC) stands before the main desk, standing behind which is Belawen, the head librarian.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The City Library was fittingly quiet as I entered the main room of the building, my footfalls sounding loud to my own ears in the huge, hushed space around me as I walked over to the main desk."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd been carrying two books which I now placed on the surface of the desk, intending to return them. There were a few stacks of books already on the desk, along with a thick ledger."
    #3. 
    player_narration "The head librarian, Belawen, was working behind the desk, sorting through one of the stacks while making notes in the ledger.  As I put down my own books, she looked up from her work and smiled at me."
    #4. 
    belawen "Good morning."
    #5. 
    player "Morning. I'm just returning these."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Belawen picked up the books and glanced at each of the two covers before putting them to one side, then her gaze returned to me."
    #7. 
    belawen "That's fine, thank you."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I smiled politely and turned to leave, but then paused and turned back as I heard Belawen begin to speak again."
    #9. 
    belawen "You, uh, wouldn't happen to be on your way to the Warriors' Guild, would you?"
    #10. 
    player_narration "Before I could reply, Belawen's eyes widened slightly and she seemed to catch herself, embarrassed, as if I might have taken offence."
    #11. 
    belawen "I don't mean to pry, of course, it's just that I've happened to see you going in there a couple of times."
    #12. 
    player "It's fine. Why do you ask?"
    #13. 
    belawen "I have some books which were supposed to be delivered to Guildmaster Rimitar today, but I'm afraid I'm swamped with work here and there's no one else in who can do it."
    #14. 
    belawen "I realise it's a bit presumptuous, so if you can't then of course I understand."
    #15. 
    player "No, it's no problem, I can do that."
    #16. 
    belawen "Oh, marvelous, thank you very much."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Belawen turned towards one of the stacks of books on the desk and carefully pulled out three particular books. She held them out to me."
    #18. 
    belawen "There we are. If you could pass these on to the guildmaster then I really would be very grateful."
    #19. 
    player_narration "I looked down at the books, moving them in my hands so as to see the cover of each one, and as I did so I frowned, puzzled."
    #20. 
    player_narration "Because if I'd had to guess as to what kind of books Rimitar would be taking out of the library then I'd have assumed they would be books involving combat or weaponry or something along those lines."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Not three volumes of love poems, which were what I held in my hands now. I looked up from the books and at Belawen, who smiled at the surprised expression which I was unable to keep from my face."
    #22. 
    belawen "You seem surprised."
    #23. 
    player "I am. I don't know Rimitar very well, but considering what he's like during the time I do spend with him... well, let's just say I didn't take him for a fan of love poetry."
    #24. 
    belawen "Oh yes. I know he's very quiet and brooding - and a hard teacher, by all accounts - but Rimitar isn't just a fan of poetry, he used to write it himself many years ago."
    #25. 
    belawen "Some of his pieces never received proper printings and so have been lost to time, sadly. If Rimitar does still have copies of them then he's not interested in sharing them."
    #26. 
    belawen "But I've read everything of his that I've been able to get my hands on, and to be frank, he's written poetry which would put some so-called masters of the form to shame."
    #27. 
    belawen "Most of his poems are about love, although a few are more adventurous and heroic in nature. All of them are wonderful."
    #28. 
    player "If he was so good at it, why did he stop? And why doesn't he want to share his poetry with anyone anymore?"
    #29. 
    player_narration "Belawen glanced around and hesitated, as if unsure about saying aloud what she had in mind. After a moment she leaned in towards me and spoke in a slightly quieter voice."
    #30. 
    belawen "Rimitar has never spoken of it, and no one else seems to be able to say for certain, but I have a theory."
    #31. 
    belawen "No lyrian could have written love poetry the likes of which Rimitar wrote without having been in love himself. To just suddenly stop in the way he did, to turn away from his gift like that..."
    #32. 
    belawen "I can't help but think that whoever it was that he loved so deeply, he must have lost her, and that's what changed him: a broken heart. It's tragic."
    #33. 
    player_narration "I nodded, thinking about Rimitar. First I learn that he used to be some famed hero, now this. There really was a lot more to that lyrian than met the eye."
    #34. 
    player "Alright, I best be off. I'll see that Rimitar receives these books."
    #35. 
    player_narration "Belawen thanked me again and I turned and left the library through the main entrance, my curiosity concerning Rimitar stronger than ever. (END OF "

    #Location: Warriors' Guild, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside a training hall at the Warriors' Guild. It is daytime, the hall illuminated by daylight entering from outside. Player-Character (PC) and Guildmaster Rimitar stand facing each other in the centre of the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Although part of me was distracted by the rumours concerning an apparent upcoming war between Lyriathis and Dahraith, I'd tried to keep my mind on the here-and-now during my latest training session at the Warriors' Guild."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Besides, absolute focus was a necessity when you were sparring with Guildmaster Rimitar - if you wanted to avoid getting absolutely battered, anyway."
    #3. 
    player_narration "As we finished a round of sparring with some wooden training swords, Rimitar called a five-minute break, although I was the only one who really needed to get my breath back."
    #4. 
    player_narration "After I'd managed to do that, and despite Rimitar's typically terse nature, I decided to take the opportunity to speak to him before we got back to the training."
    #5. 
    player "Sir? I take it you've heard the rumours going around about war breaking out between us and the Dahris...?"
    #6. 
    player_narration "I paused, waiting for an answer, but none came as Rimitar placed the training swords we'd been using back in their rack. I pressed on."
    #7. 
    player "I was just wondering what you thought about it. Do you really think it'll happen? If it did, do you think Lyriathis would win?"
    #8. 
    player_narration "Having returned the swords, Rimitar walked back over to me unarmed. He came to a stop and looked at me with his usual grave expression."

    #12. 
    player "Well, I - "
    #13. 
    rimitar "Not as much as you think you do, I'd wager. Few Lyris do."
    #14. 
    rimitar "No doubt you were told the same as everyone else growing up: tales of the evil Dahris, our ancient and hated enemy, the dark and wicked counterpart to the more civilised and morally upright Lyris..."
    #15. 
    rimitar "Life is very, very rarely that simple. The Dahris are not monsters, they're people, just like us, with all of the qualities and flaws that make people everywhere - whatever their race - what they are."
    #16. 
    player "You sound like you're very familiar with them. Do you know any Dahris well, then?"

    player_narration "Apparently one of the rooms upstairs was being rented by a fellow Lyris - Meda said I could share the room with him if I liked, and that this was the best she could do."

    PART A

    #Location: A street somewhere in Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are on a street somewhere in Belgran. It is night and the street is quiet. Player-Character (PC) walks along the street, alone, until he is confronted by a gang of three criminals.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Belgran's recent festival was now a memory, and while thoughts of the day occasionally popped into my head, one thing in particular had remained: Elyndir, the dahrian who I'd ended up sharing a room with at the Moon and Sabre."
    #2. 
    player_narration "While we were no longer sharing a room - within a couple of days of the end of the festival, the inns and guest-houses of Belgran once again had rooms available - both of us were still staying at the Moon and Sabre."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I was glad I'd chosen not to let any inherent mistrust of the Dahris stop me from staying with Elyndir and getting to know him, as he turned out to be a likeable enough dahrian, albeit one who could be quite cutting when he chose to be."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I suspected there was more to him beneath the surface, however, something driving him but which he kept to himself - he could be secretive, and there was an intensity to him which flared up at times."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Although I'd tried to subtly question him about his past, his purpose in  Belgran and other details about himself, he always managed to avoid the question somehow. "
    #6. 
    player_narration "Also, he often left the Moon and Sabre at night, quietly exiting his room and being gone from the tavern for up to hours at a time."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The first time I'd noticed this had been by accident, but then I made a point of listening out for it on following nights. Unsurprisingly, Elyndir never mentioned his nocturnal jaunts to me."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Although part of me thought I should just mind my own business and that I was only being suspicious of Elyndir because he was a Dahris..."
    #9. 
    player_narration "...another part of me couldn't help but wonder if his outward personality was all a façade, a mask he wore to hide his true self. Ultimately I still didn't really know anything about him, after all."


    #10. 
    player_narration "In the end, my curiosity got the better of me. Earlier tonight I'd made a point of staying awake until eventually, as I hoped I might, I once again heard Elyndir quietly leaving the Moon and Sabre. Trying to be quieter still, I followed him."
    #11. 
    player_narration "The night air was cold and the wind piercing as I slipped out of the tavern, the surrounding streets dark and empty - apart from Elyndir, who I saw move into an alley down the street. Keeping my distance and sticking to the shadows, I continued to follow."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Pursuing Elyndir took me through a number of Belgran's quieter streets and alleys - wherever the dahrian was going, apparently he wanted to get there in as discreet a fashion as possible."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Occasionally I saw Granians out and about, alone or in pairs at most. We ignored one another, the hood I wore up over my head hiding my noteworthy nature as a Lyris."
    #14. 
    player_narration "A few times I thought Elyndir might have realised that someone was following him, but every time he stopped and paused, eventually he always pressed on again."
    #15. 
    player_narration "After following Elyndir around one particular street corner, I suddenly  found he was nowhere to be seen. I moved in the direction he'd have most likely taken but was greeted by nothing but empty cobbles."
    #16. 
    player_narration "I doubled back, tried a nearby alley, but met with the same result. I scanned my surroundings: nothing. I cursed and accepted that I'd lost him."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Even so, I wasn't ready to give up completely, and so I spent the next twenty minutes searching the surrounding streets and alleys, trying to remain discreet while keeping an eye out for Elyndir."
    #18. 
    player_narration "But my searching turned out to be fruitless, and I was standing alone in an empty alley when I reluctantly decided to give up and return to the Moon and Sabre. It seemed Elyndir's secrets would remain hidden from me for now."
    #19. 
    player_narration "I turned to leave the alley only to see a cloaked and hooded figure appear from around the corner and stand before me, blocking the alley mouth."
    #20. 
    player_narration "Due to the darkness, the figure's clothing and the distance between us, I couldn't really make out any details, although the fact that they stood in silence, facing me and blocking the alley at that end instantly put me on edge."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Tense but trying to appear calm, I turned around and began walking in the opposite direction. I soon stooped, however, when a second person - also cloaked and hooded - appeared from around the corner ahead."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Like the first person, the newcomer stood at the end of the alley, facing me and blocking my exit. So this was how it was going to be."
    #23. 
    player_narration "Movement in one corner of my eye caused me to turn my head towards a smaller, adjoining alley which would have been my one remaining exit - if a third shadowy figure hadn't just appeared there, standing and watching me like the others."
    #24. 
    player_narration "I moved slowly, trying to keep all three people within my field of vision, breathing slowly and mentally preparing myself for what was about to happen. The first figure began walking towards me, and the other two followed his lead."

    #25. 
    player_narration "I turned so that I was facing across the alley and in the direction of the third figure. I backed up a few steps. I quickly looked over my surroundings, hoping to spot some other way out which I'd missed, but there was nothing."
    #26. 
    player_narration "When the three cloaked and hooded figures came to within about ten feet of me, surrounding me, they stopped. I still couldn't make out much of their features or even tell what they race they were, although all three seemed to be male."
    #27. 
    player_narration "Apart from a few distant, scattered sounds - a dog barking, someone coughing, a wooden sign creaking in the wind - the night was silent. My three assailants made no sound and said no words as they drew their knives."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I took a slow, deep breath and got ready."
    #29. 
    elyndir "Back away. [He's / She's] with me."
    #30. 
    player_narration "The three figures and I looked towards the alley from which the third of them had emerged only to see Elyndir standing there now, watching us with a hard frown. His eyes roamed over the people surrounding me."
    #31. 
    elyndir "The Lyris is my partner. I wanted [him / her] to shadow me tonight as a test of [his / her] skills."
    #32. 
    elyndir "Touch [him/ her] and you and I are going to have a problem, and I'd hate to see our relationship sour so soon."
    #33. 
    player_narration "The three figures glanced at each other before their eyes moved back to Elyndir. One of them - I knew him to be a Granian now, judging by his voice - spoke with an annoyed, accusatory edge."
    #34. 
    cloaked_granian "You never said anything about a partner."
    #35. 
    elyndir "I didn't see the need. Frankly, I wasn't expecting [him / her] to run into you fine gentlemen."
    #36. 
    elyndir "But now we're all clear on things, so if you'd put away the knives and leave me to have a talk with my partner? Alone?"
    #37. 
    player_narration "The men looked at each other again before seemingly coming to a silent agreement - they slowly lowered their knives and backed away from me. Even so, I remained ready to defend myself."
    #38. 
    player_narration "The man who'd spoken previously looked at me and then at Elyndir."
    #39. 
    cloaked_granian "Alright, then. But you and your partner should be more careful in future, whether you're walking down dark alleys or keeping secrets from people you're supposed to be working with. Both of those things can turn out very nasty..."
    #40. 
    cloaked_granian "See you soon, Dahris."
    #41. 
    player_narration "The man had apparently said his piece, and didn't wait for any kind of reply from Elyndir. He turned and began walking down the alley, his two colleagues following him."
    #42. 
    player_narration "They moved calmly and quietly, pocketing their knives once more as they went. Eventually they disappeared around the corner."
    #43. 
    player_narration "Although I couldn't help but relax a little, I remained on edge due to the continued presence of Elyndir, whose gaze was focused on me now, his expression serious. I looked back, waiting for him to make the first move."
    #44. 
    player_narration "To my surprise, one corner of Elyndir's mouth lifted in a smile."
    #45. 
    elyndir "A curious one, aren't you. Come with me, maybe I'll give you some of the answers you're looking for."
    #46. 
    player_narration "With that, Elyndir turned around and began walking back into the alley from which he'd emerged."
    #47. 
    player_narration "I paused, wondering if I should follow him or if perhaps the more sensible option was to walk off alone in a different direction and back to the Moon and Sabre, and to forget my curiosity regarding the dahrian."
    #48. 
    player_narration "I followed Elyndir into the alley. (GO TO PART B)"





































    PART B

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre tavern in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is quiet, with only a few scattered men drinking as they sit at tables or at the counter. Working behind the counter is the young man who works as Meda's assistant. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir are sitting together at a table in a corner of the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "After my encounter with the three cut-throats who'd cornered me after I lost Elyndir, the dahrian had led me back to the Moon and Sabre. When I demanded answers, he said we'd talk over a drink."
    #2. 
    player_narration "At this late hour, Meda was in bed, the handful of customers scattered around the tavern being served by the young man who worked part-time as her assistant."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I walked up to the counter and he ordered an ale. When it arrived, I took the tankard for myself, raised it and took a long swallow. Elyndir turned to look at me, raising one eyebrow. "
    #4. 
    player_narration "I set down the tankard but kept it in my hand as I looked back at him with a flat expression. After my meeting with his charming, knife-wielding friends, I figured Elyndir owed me a drink. He ordered another ale for himself."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Elyndir led me to a table in a quiet corner of the room, a spot far enough away from everyone else that our conversation wouldn't be overheard. He took a drink and then looked at me with a serious expression."
    #6. 
    elyndir "Now listen: if I'm going to share these details with you then as far as I'm concerned, there's no going back - for you."
    #7. 
    elyndir "I'd be placing my trust in you, and that is not something I do lightly. Nor is it something I'd forgive if the person I trusted betrayed me. Do you understand?"
    #8. 
    elyndir "But it's your choice. If you don't want to get involved any further then say so now. We'll finish these drinks and say no more about it."
    #9. 
    elyndir "So which is it?"
    #10. 
    player_narration "Given what I'd seen of the type of people Elyndir worked with, part of me immediately insisted that becoming further involved with the dahrian was a terrible idea which could get me into very serious trouble."
    #11. 
    player_narration "But even so, that curiosity which had been strong enough to see me sneaking out after dark and following Elyndir through the city hadn't disappeared. I thought about it as I drank some of my ale."

    player_narration "Given my previous encounter with Elyndir's three knife-wielding acquaintances, naturally I'd been wary of what the job would entail, expecting something dangerous."
    #4. 
    player_narration "But in the end it had turned out to be quite pedestrian, Elyndir and I only being required to deliver a sealed package to an unnamed man at the back door of a particular shop..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...and to take another package from him, which we were to then deliver to another unnamed man at a different location. It was from the second man that Elyndir received the second half of our payment, the first half having been demanded up-front."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I asked Elyndir what the packages contained but he said he didn't know - or care. I didn't know if he was telling the truth or not but either way I didn't press the issue. "
    #7. 
    player_narration "We hadn't spoken about the job - or future jobs, or anything else concerning our new partnership - since arriving at the Moon and Sabre, instead just chatting amiably as we often did."
    #8. 
    player_narration "A Granian bard was sitting in another corner of the room, playing a lute and singing, and his performance was pleasant enough but not something I was paying a lot of attention to."


    #9. 
    player_narration "That changed, however, when he suddenly began playing a familiar song, one which took me a few seconds to recognise, but then it hit me: it was the song written about Rimitar, which I'd heard for the first time in the Golden Meadow in Lyr-Taer."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Although I didn't think this Granian bard was as talented as the lyrian I'd seen perform in the Golden Meadow, he gave a decent enough performance and carried the song well. I turned to Elyndir."
    #11. 
    player "You might not believe this, but do you remember when we first met and I mentioned a lyrian named Rimitar? My teacher at the Warriors' Guild in Lyr-Taer?"
    #12. 
    player_narration "I waited for some kind of response but Elyndir - who was frowning now, I noticed - simply looked back at me in silence. Undaunted, I continued."
    #13. 
    player "Well, this song is actually about him. Really. He used to be a famous adventurer, travelling all over the lands, fighting evil wherever he found it, all that sort of thing."
    #14. 
    player "I suppose some people must know him in Grana as well as in Lyriathis, otherwise I doubt this bard would be playing the song."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Elyndir was looking off across the room with the same frown on his face, and didn't look back at me as he grunted dismissively and then spoke."
    #16. 
    elyndir "The noble, flawless Lyris hero fighting for justice and protecting the innocent... what a lovely fairytale."
    #17. 
    player "Well, some of it's exaggerated or missing things, no doubt. I know he travelled with a group of companions for a time, and this song doesn't mention them."
    #18. 
    player "Actually, you might be interested to hear that one of them was a Dahris. A dahria mage, to be specific."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Elyndir turned his gaze on me now and he didn't look interested, he looked angry, even if only for a moment. Then he lifted his tankard, drained the remaining ale in several long swallows, and stood up. He nodded at my own tankard."
    #20. 
    elyndir "Another one?"
    #21. 
    player "No, I'm alright, I've still got about half left."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Elyndir walked off towards the counter without another word, and I wondered what was bothering him."
    #23. 
    player_narration "Was it the fact that no Dahris companion was mentioned in the legend of Rimitar as portrayed in this song and probably other tales? I doubted it, Elyndir had never struck me as the type to care about something like that."
    #24. 
    player_narration "Whatever it was, I decided not to push him on the subject. As I waited for Elyndir to return, I sat and drank and listened to the bard as he continued singing of "

    #Location: The Moon and Sabre, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are in the Moon and Sabre in Belgran. It is night, the place illuminated by candles and glass lamps. The tavern is busy, with men and women drinking and talking as they sit at tables or at the bar. Working behind the bar is Meda, the owner of the tavern. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir are sitting together at a table in a corner of the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "As I entered the main room of the Moon and Sabre, I stopped as I spotted Elyndir sitting alone at the bar, staring into the tankard he held in one hand."
    #2. 
    player_narration "My surprise didn't come from seeing Elyndir drinking in the tavern but rather that he hadn't invited me to have a drink with him as he usually did. I walked over to the bar and took a seat on the empty stool next to him."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Meda was working and I asked her for an ale. As she poured my drink, I looked over at Elyndir, who only glanced at me before returning his attention to his tankard, his expression thoughtful."

    player "Evening."
    #5. 
    elyndir "Evening."

    elyndir "Well, you're here now. If you insist then you can buy me an ale when I'm done with this one."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Meda handed me my drink and I paid her. She wandered off down the other end of the bar as I sipped my ale and looked at Elyndir. He didn't seem to be his usual self."
    #9. 
    player "Is everything alright? You seem a little distracted."
    #10. 
    elyndir "Just something on my mind. I've learned some interesting information."

    player_narration "I waited for Elyndir to elaborate but instead he just took a drink from his tankard. But I wasn't going to let him just leave it at that."
    #12. 
    player "Well? What is it?"

    #13. 
    elyndir "An opportunity has presented itself. If I decide to act on it, it could cause me a lot of trouble... or it could be very beneficial."
    #14. 
    player "So...?"
    #15. 
    player_narration "Elyndir turned in my direction and finally gave me his full attention. He lowered his voice slightly although the tavern wasn't particularly busy, with no one close enough to overhear us."
    #16. 
    elyndir "There's a new group of smugglers in town. A rough bunch, by all accounts. And arrogant."
    #17. 
    elyndir "Apparently these smugglers have decided that, unlike most other sensible criminals in Belgran, they don't need to pay a cut of their profits to the Thieves' Guild."
    #18. 
    elyndir "Needless to say, this hasn't sat well with the guild. They want to make an example of these smugglers. And they're offering a handsome reward to anyone willing to do just that."
    #19. 
    elyndir "But it's not just about the money. My gaining favour with the Thieves' Guild could turn out to be just as valuable."
    #20. 
    elyndir "I've heard a rumour regarding the supposed place where these smugglers meet, and if what else I've heard is true then I know when they're bringing in their next shipment..."
    #21. 
    elyndir "...but what I don't know is exactly how many of them there are, or just how capable they are in a fight. And that's the kind of information that can make the difference between life and death."
    #22.

    #Location: Smugglers' Warehouse, Belgran, Grana (Night)
    #● We are inside a warehouse somewhere in Belgran. It is night, the only illumination coming from the moonlight which enters through several high windows. There are a number of crates of various types stacked around the room. Player-Character (PC) and Elyndir have broken into the warehouse and are now stealthily exploring it. There is no one else in sight.
    #1. 
    player_narration "After I'd agreed to help Elyndir put the new group of smugglers in Belgran out of business, he continued learning what he could about the newcomers while at the same time being careful not to make them aware of his interest."
    #2. 
    player_narration "He'd also informed the Thieves' Guild of his intentions, but of course they were more interested in results than intentions, so Elyndir had to actually get the job done before he'd gain any favour with the guild."

    player_narration "He eventually came to me with the location of the back-alley warehouse out of which the smugglers seemed to be operating."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Also, although he was confident they'd brought in their latest shipment as he'd heard they would, he hadn't been able to find out what this shipment consisted of."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Elyndir's plan was simple. The two of us would infiltrate the warehouse at night and see what we could learn about the smugglers and their goods."
    #6. 
    player_narration "If the situation presented itself, we'd put an end to the smugglers and their operation there and then. If not, we'd at least have gathered more information on our targets."

    player_narration "The room was dark and, due to the crates and barrels, contained a lot of blind spots. Elyndir leaned towards me and spoke in a whisper."

    player_narration "It was after midnight as Elyndir and I walked the chilly and dark Belgran streets. We'd met up earlier and were now on our way to meet a contact of Elyndir's, a man he wanted information from."
    #2. 
    player_narration "We'd kept a low profile since the night we broke into the smugglers' warehouse, but now Elyndir had finally had enough and decided to take action, with me along for the ride."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Wearing our hoods up over our heads, we kept to the smaller streets, which were quiet, only a few scattered Granians passing us in silence along the way."
    #4. 
    player_narration "We were walking along a narrow alley lined by buildings when two cloaked and hooded figures stepped out of the shadows ahead of us and stood facing us, blocking our path. Elyndir and I stopped."
    #5. 
    player_narration "A moment later, two more figures appeared behind us, blocking that way as well. We were trapped, and neither of us had seen it coming. We held our ground, tense but calm, waiting to see who'd make the first move."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I was wondering if these were simply common thieves or if they had specifically targeted Elyndir and I when one of the two ahead of us approached and answered my question for me."
    #7. 
    salys "Elyndir... it's been a long time."
    #8. 
    player_narration "The figure stopped before he got too close, and lowered his hood to reveal the face of a dahrian. He had a thin smile on his lips as he looked at Elyndir."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I glanced over at Elyndir, who was looking back at the dahrian with an expression of recognition. But while Elyndir seemed to know him, he certainly didn't look happy to see him."
    #10. 
    elyndir "Salys. I heard you were dead. I should've known you'd crawl out from under yet another rock eventually."

    #11. 
    salys "You can't keep a good dahrian down, Elyndir. And is that any way to greet an old friend?"
    #12. 
    elyndir "I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. Let's not waste each other's time pretending otherwise, eh?"
    #13. 
    player_narration "Salys' smile disappeared, although he retained the confidence and composure of someone who has his enemy trapped and outnumbered."
    #14. 
    salys "Alright. You stole something very important. Some weapons. It's my job to retrieve them."
    #15. 
    player_narration "Elyndir barked an abrupt, mocking laugh and shook his head."
    #16. 
    elyndir "You're a member of the new smuggling gang in Belgran? How the mighty have fallen. And here I thought those smugglers might be something worth worrying about..."
    #17. 
    salys "I'm no smuggler. You're the common criminal, Elyndir, not me. I'm helping to keep my country and its people safe."
    #18. 
    elyndir "Salys, the noble and heroic patriot... don't make me laugh."
    #19. 
    salys "As fond as I've always been of our chats, I think I've already wasted enough time on you. You stole from the wrong people, and now you face the consequences."
    #20. 
    salys "Although perhaps my friends and I could see our way to going easy on you... if you return all of the weapons to us right now."
    #21. 
    elyndir "I have no idea what weapons you're talking about."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Salys turned his attention to me."
    #23. 
    salys "Maybe you've got the sense to be more talkative. Why don't you lower your hood so we can get a good look at the face of Elyndir's friend?"

    #6. 
    player_narration "Despite that help, however, within minutes of his visit earlier today it became obvious that Olin didn't approve of Elyndir or his being here, my brother's manner being curt and suspicious."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Elyndir did his best to keep his cool, but I knew he'd only suffer Olin's sniping for so long, and the atmosphere was tense as we all sat down at the dinner table to eat, even though my parents and I did our best to ignore it and lighten the mood."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Olin barely touched his food, instead focusing his attention on Elyndir."
    #9. 
    olin "They won't just arrest you if they find you here, you know. They'll arrest my mother and father as well. Whether you give a damn about your heritage or not, the authorities won't care - my parents will be accused of harbouring an enemy of the state."
    #10. 
    olin "I'd be stripped of my rank, of course. Possibly worse. And as for my [brother / sister], they'd have plenty of questions for [him / her] as well."

    #11. 
    elyndir "I have no intention of causing trouble for you or your family. I'm just here to learn."

    #16. 
    laurin "So while you're here we expect you to treat him with some civility, alright? Now, eat your food."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Olin continued to only pick at his food while the rest of us ate, and although he didn't say anything else to Elyndir, the tension between them remained."
    #18. 
    player_narration "I was relieved when lunch eventually came to an end. We all cleared the table and then my mother asked Olin to help her collect some things from outside, while my father went upstairs."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I sat back down at the dinner table, both of us relaxing slightly now, although I remained annoyed at Olin for his behaviour towards Elyndir, even if it did come from a desire to protect the family."
    #20. 
    player "Sorry about my brother. He's not being like that because you're a Dahris, he's just..."

    #Plot by Katja Alexeeva

    #Script by Alex De-Gruchy




    #Location: A forest clearing, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in a clearing somewhere in a forest in Lyriathis. It is sometime during the day. Rimitar and Elyndir stand facing each other while Player-Character (PC) stands between them and off to one side.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The journey which Rimitar and I had taken together from Lyr-Taer came to an end as we entered the forest clearing where I'd arranged for Elyndir to meet us."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Rimitar and I had spoken about various subjects during our journey, but his past was still something he didn't like to talk about much."
    #3. 
    player_narration "And during the final few hours of our journey, Rimitar had barely spoken at all, the upcoming meeting with the dahrian who seemed to be his son no doubt weighing heavier and heavier on his mind as we neared our destination."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Elyndir stood in the centre of the clearing, waiting for us, his face expressionless as he watched us approach. As for Rimitar, his brow was furrowed in a thoughtful frown as he studied Elyndir."
    #5. 
    player_narration "We came to a stop about ten feet away from Elyndir, he and Rimitar directly facing each other while I stood slightly off to one side, not wanting to get between them. They looked at each other in silence."
    #6. 
    player "Elyndir, meet Rimitar."
    #7. 
    player "Rimitar, this is my friend Elyndir."
    #8. 
    elyndir "Bastard!"
    #9. 
    player_narration "Elyndir's furious, hissed insult in Rimitar's direction came at the same time as he lunged forward and drew his sword, the rage on his face making it instantly clear that he intended to kill the guildmaster."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Rimitar's reflexes were incredibly sharp, however, and whatever he might have been expecting of Elyndir just moments before, now the dahrian was an immediate threat, and Rimitar had plenty of experience dealing with those."
    #11. 
    player_narration "Rimitar drew his own sword just in time to block Elyndir's first attack, and the guildmaster then remained on the defensive as Elyndir's rage fuelled his offence, the dahrian swinging and thrusting his sword as Rimitar blocked and dodged."

    #12. 
    player_narration "As for me, I was momentarily frozen to the spot in shock. What the hell was Elyndir doing?"
    #13. 
    elyndir "I'll kill you for all the pain you've caused me and my mother, you coward!"
    #14. 
    rimitar "Lower your weapon before someone gets hurt! We can talk about this!"
    #15. 
    player_narration "Although there were a few moments where Rimitar could have taken the offensive and turned Elyndir's aggression against him, he chose to continue defending instead, apparently hoping Elyndir would calm down."
    #16. 
    player_narration "But if that was his hope then it seemed to be in vain, as Elyndir's bloodlust showed no sign of abating as he continued to launch attack after attack."
    #17. 
    player_narration "I'd never realised that this was the reason Elyndir wanted to find his father: vengeance."
    #18. 
    player_narration "The fact that he'd hidden this from me, that he'd used me in this way, called into question everything I thought I knew about him and what kind of person he was."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Had I been deluded all along? Was Elyndir really nothing more than a lying, revenge-driven criminal? Or was his desire for vengeance understandable, if perhaps misguided?"

    #21.30.
    player_narration "Then Rimitar's eyes rolled up in their sockets, the arm which he was using to prop himself up went limp, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious, the hand in which he'd been holding his sword unfolding. "#(GO TO 21.31.)

    #Script by Alex De-Gruchy





    #Location: The Sacred Grove, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the #Eternal Forest, specifically the Sacred Grove, the place where Player-Character's (PC's) birth tree was planted. PC and Elyndir stand side-by-side at the edge of the grove. It is morning and the sun is shining.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was early in the morning, the sun still low in the sky, when Elyndir and I arrived at the Sacred Grove after having walked there together from my parents' house."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The grove was close enough to home that I could take Elyndir there, show him the grove and my birth tree, and then have him back early enough that he could spend the rest of the day continuing his magic studies with my father."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I knew well enough that travelling somewhere with Elyndir, even to a location not that far away, brought with it an increased chance of him being spotted and possibly reported to the authorities..."
    #4. 
    player_narration "...but the grove and my birth tree were important to me, and I wanted to share them with him."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I hadn't told him where we were going, only that there was something I wanted him to see. I told him to wear a cloak and hood, and to keep the latter over his head."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I admit that for a moment it felt strange walking into the Sacred Grove with a Dahris at my side..."
    #7. 
    player_narration "...but I suppose that was to be expected given that this place - and the natural, life-affirming magic which was so strong here - had been such a bitter point of contention between the Lyris and the Dahris for so very long."
    #8. 
    player_narration "But I quickly reminded myself that it wasn't just a Dahris at my side, it was Elyndir, and that when it came to that ancient enmity between the Lyris and Dahris, he felt the same way as me: he didn't really care."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I'd wanted to leave home early so that we'd hopefully arrive at the grove at a time when there was likely to be no one around, and now I was relieved to see that was the case."
    #10. 
    player_narration "We paused at the edge of the grove, Elyndir's head moving as his eyes roamed over the birth trees. The grass and leaves rustled gently in the cool morning breeze as I watched him."
    #11. 
    elyndir "Is this... the Sacred Grove?"
    #12. 
    player "Yes."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Although he was good at playing his cards close to his chest, I was glad to see a smile appear on Elyndir's lips. I don't think he even knew he was doing it."
    #14. 
    player "What do you think?"
    #15. 
    elyndir "...It's beautiful."
    #16. 
    player_narration "I started walking deeper into the grove, Elyndir once again falling into step beside me. We moved at a relaxed pace, taking in and enjoying the atmosphere."
    #17. 
    player_narration "A hint of a smile remained on Elyndir's lips, and he looked more at peace than I'd ever seen him."
    #18. 
    player_narration "I wondered if him being half-Lyris and possessing the inherent healing magic that he did made him feel an instinctive connection to the Sacred Grove. With his Lyris heritage, I thought it a shame that Elyndir didn't have his own birth tree."
    #19. 
    player "These are all birth trees. When a Lyris is born, their family plants a birth tree for them as a symbol of life and growth."
    #20. 
    player "But the birth trees are more than that. Each tree becomes fundamentally connected to the Lyris whose birth it marks. So when that Lyris dies, so does their tree."
    #21. 
    elyndir "I'm assuming it doesn't work the other way around - that if I start chopping down these trees, Lyris are going to start dropping dead a hundred miles away."
    #22. 
    player "No, it doesn't work that way. Although losing a birth tree can still be a terrible blow to a Lyris."
    #23. 
    player_narration "After walking for a time, I came to a stop at the specific spot to which I'd been leading elyndir "my own birth tree. Elyndir looked at the tree and then at me.""
    #24. 
    player "This is my tree."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I both admired my birth tree as I ran a hand over the bark of the trunk. The tree was healthy and growing well, its branches thick and filled with leaves and reaching towards the sky."
    #26. 
    player_narration "Growing out of the ground at the base of my tree were some wild flowers. They were in full bloom, their colour a mixture of brilliant shades of purple and blue."
    #27. 
    player_narration "I picked one of the flowers and brought it up to my nose, breathing in its sweet fragrance. I held the flower out to Elyndir. He accepted it and smiled at me."
    #28. 
    elyndir "Thank you."
    #29. 
    elyndir "...Hang on, this isn't some kind of Lyris marriage ceremony that you're tricking me into, is it?"
    #30. 
    player_narration "I laughed and gave Elyndir a playful smack on the shoulder as he grinned at me."
    #31. 
    player "You wish."
    #32. 
    player_narration "I sat before my birth tree, gestured towards the ground next to me and looked up at Elyndir."
    #33. 
    player "Sit down."
    #34. 
    player_narration "Elyndir looked around, checking to see if we were still the only people in sight. Once he was satisfied that we were, he sat next to me."
    #35. 
    player_narration "We didn't say anything for a while, both of us simply enjoying the tranquility of the Sacred Grove, comfortable in each other's company. Elyndir held onto his flower, studying it now and again."
    #36. 
    elyndir "It's hard to think that a place like this could inspire hatred and conflict like it does between the Dahris and Lyris. Seems to me like someone's missing the point."
    #37. 
    player "I know. Most people seem to just accept that the Dahris and Lyris are enemies and that's how it's always going to be, when at the end of the day we're all just people. It's nonsense. Hopefully things will change in time."
    #38. 
    elyndir "It would be nice to think so. I know it's something my mother's always wanted. I suppose that's why I grew up not hating the Lyris like so many other Dahris of my age did. She taught me it didn't matter."
    #39. 
    elyndir "Although my mother has actively worked to try to improve relations between the Dahris and Lyris over the years, and I've never gone that far."
    #40. 
    elyndir "I've always been more focused on looking out for myself. In my line of work that attitude helps keep you alive."
    #41. 
    elyndir "But being here now... I think I understand a little better why she does it, even if she's never seen this place. As far as I know, anyway."
    #42. 
    player "It's people like your mother who'll make a difference. As I said, things will change."
    #43. 
    elyndir "I suppose we'll see."
    #44. 
    player_narration "Elyndir and I smiled at each other and then settled into another comfortable silence."
    #45. 
    player_narration "The sun continued to rise in the sky, scattered rays of its light filtering through the leaves of the trees and dappling the grove floor below."
    #46. 
    player_narration "As beautiful a sight as it was, it was also a reminder that time was passing, and that the longer Elyndir and I remained here, the greater the risk we were taking."
    #47. 
    player_narration "Reluctantly I suggested that it was best we head home, and Elyndir - just as reluctantly - agreed. He rose to his feet and offered me his hand, helping me up."
    #48. 
    player_narration "Rather than let go of his hand, I held onto it, and we left the Sacred Grove that way, connected to each other as well as to the beauty and magic "

    #Location: Forest clearing, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are in a forest clearing on the outskirts of Lyriathis, near the Dahraith border, the clearing surrounded by woodland. It is night, the only light coming from the moon and stars. Player-Character (PC) and Gweyr stand in the clearing, facing each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "When Melas had told me that my new job for the Thieves' Guild involved travelling, I'd hoped I might be visiting somewhere more interesting than a small clearing in the middle of dense woodland near the Dahraith border, but here I was."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Although this would be the first time I'd meet the Dahris smuggler who was my contact, so maybe other, more varied destinations would come up in the future."
    #3. 
    player_narration "For now I stood at the edge of the clearing and waited, the breeze sighing through the trees, my eyes having long adjusted to the darkness after having spent the past several hours walking through it."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Before I left Lyr-Taer, Melas had given me the details I needed for my upcoming meeting with the smuggler... "
    #5. 
    player_narration "...although those amounted to little more than a location, a date, and the items I was expected to receive in exchange for the Thieves' Guild money which Melas gave me."
    #6. 
    player_narration "The journey towards the border had been uneventful, and of course I'd made a point of sticking to the quieter roads and lesser-known woodland paths before venturing off into wilder country entirely."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I stood with my back to a large tree as I looked around the clearing, alert as I watched and listened for any sign of the Dahris smuggler."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Eventually I heard a twig snap somewhere amongst the trees on the opposite side of the clearing, and I tensed, ready to reach for my weapon if necessary."
    #9. 
    player_narration "From the shadows emerged a figure wearing a hood and cloak. I couldn't see the face but by the size and body shape she was clearly female. This must be my contact."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Despite her relatively small size she must've been strong, as on her back she was carrying a large pack – I assumed this was full of the items she was smuggling."
    #11. 
    player_narration "The figure walked towards the centre of the moonlit clearing with no hesitation, so I did the same, and soon we came to a stop within around ten feet of each other."
    #12. 
    player_narration "The smuggler took hold of her hood and lowered it, and while it was indeed a dahria, I was surprised at how young and fresh-faced she looked. I hadn't really expected anything specific, but at the same time I hadn't expected this."
    #13. 
    player_narration "The smuggler looked me over with a frown, but despite her hard expression I got the feeling she was trying to appear tougher than she actually was."

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. There are a number of customers scattered around the room. Player-Character (PC) stands before the bar, facing Yandar, who stands behind the bar.

    #8.

    #● We are in the main room of the Lyr-Taer Goods Emporium in Lyr-Taer. It is daytime, the room illuminated by the sunlight entering through the windows. Aistar stands behind the counter as Player-Character (PC) enters the shop.

    #3. 
    player_narration "I'd initially considered simply buying a fork and pretending that I'd stolen it, but I was certain that if the guild saw through me then I could wave goodbye to any chance of ever joining them."

    player_narration "Besides, I wanted to be a thief, and thieves stole things."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I'd already practice stealing a couple of things even smaller than a fork, and in less risky circumstances, but now it was time for my first real step."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I was glad to find myself the only customer in the shop, the only other person present being Aistar, who stood behind the counter, leaning on it with his elbows."

    player_narration "He opened the case and sure enough, laid out on a base of velvet inside were over a dozen pieces of silver cutlery, the knives, forks and spoons all polished to a sheen, their handles displaying elaborate patterns."

    player_narration "I didn't know how things turned out for the patient in the end, but now I couldn't help but wonder."
    #35. 
    player_narration "It was a similar situation with my mother's alchemy: I knew there were complicated recipes which she'd been interested in attempting in the past but hadn't been able to due to lack of necessary ingredients from Dahraith."

    #Location: Sacred Grove

    #1.  
    The tranquility of the Sacred Grove had always brought me more peace than anywhere else. 
    #2.  
    To simply sit beneath the shade of the Elven Birth Trees connected me to the earth.  I felt united with all life and the Goddess of all nature. 
    #3.  
    Such meditations revitalized me and I was renewed in spirit, mind and body.
    #4.  
    With no more effort than one puts to the beating of their heart, I meandered to my birth tree and eased into a sit
    beneath its comforting boughs.
    #5.  
    Lifting my eyes toward the sky, I watched the breeze shift the leaves. I listened to the Goddess Nature's whisper.
    #6.  
    Although it was no language of words, her message filled me with serenity and a sense of stillness.
    #7.  
    The redolent perfume of woodsy, floral spice and musty earth filled my nostrils as I drew in a deep, cleansing 
    breath. 
    #8.  
    I breathed in fortitude and tranquility, then exhaled my insecurities, fears and unspent anger. 
    #9.  
    I felt tension melting from every limb, each muscle relaxing in gentle waves until finally my body was in a state of
    harmony.

    EPISODE (EXTRA) 
    #Location: Sacred Grove
    #1.  
    I went to the Grove, heart heavy and mind cluttered. Indeed, I needed to find that peace again.
    #2.  
    Passing through radiant beams of sun, piercing through the forest canopy, I passed from cool shadow into brief 
    caresses of warmth.
    #3.  
    Dust motes drifted and danced down through the taught ribbons of gold. As one paused to perch on my nose I 
    saw that no, 'twas not a speck of dust, though tiny and easily dismissed as such.
    #4.  
    In fact, it was a teeny sprite, skin of a pale dusky grey.  It tickled my nose a moment more with the faintest chitter,
    like a cricket giggling, then flitted off into the dappled wood. 
    #5.  
    I thought of the tiny sprite, so much smaller than I, and how I, too, was dwarfed by the ancient trees of the wood.
    #6.  
    Creatures infinitely smaller than I face the world with bravery, and still find joy. I could find strength in that. 
    #7.  
    Out of this was born an inner strength, that I could endure and continue in my trials, face all that would come. 
    Perhaps that was her message.
    #8.  
    How could I not also if such a tiny sprite could? The Goddess Nature was challenging me to laugh at the world 
    in spite of my sorrows or fears.

    [EPISODE (EXTRA) CONT.]
    #9.  
    Listening closer to the delicate rustle of the leaves, I contemplated this revelation. In the Goddess' wisdom, 
    I would trust her to correct me if such a conclusion was incorrect.
    #10.  
    No correction or amendment came, just more cool wisps of wind and wafts of sweet honeysuckle.
    #11.  
    If a dusty sprite could face a giant and giggle, I can face...whatever and at the very least hold my head high.
    #12.  
    I had come to the grove, seeking connection to the earth, Unity with all Living things.  I had thought to find it
    through the Birth Trees.
    #13.  
    Instead, I found it in a dust mote on a sunbeam and the breeze.

    EPISODE TWO 
    #Location: Sacred Grove
    #1.  
    Eager for another soothing meditation beneath the Birth Trees of my brethren, I return to the Sacred Grove.
    #2.  
    Relaxed and focused upon my breath, I slowed my heart and stilled my thoughts.
    #3.  
    Tendrils of consciousness crept into my mind, like long sharp fingers jabbing at my heart.
    #4.  
    I could not focus, distracted by a sense of pain and sorrow that was not mine.
    (a) See if they need help [[go to  5.1]]
    (b) Concentrate on my meditations  [[go to 6.1 ]]
    (c) Put a stop to the disturbance [[go to  7.1]]
    #5.1  
    I would seek out the source of this pain. Someone was suffering. Perhaps I could help. Weaving through the
    wood, following the waves of sorrow, I soon came upon the wellspring of such sadness.
    #5.2  
    Crumpled with the weight of his misery, an elf much older than I sat slumped beneath a Birth Tree.  He
    was not poorly dressed, quite fine garments, in fact. There were no signs of injury or assault. 
    #5.3  
    Lingering a moment, I observed him from a distance with empathy.  Truly, I could feel his every emotion.        A sadness that only loss can bring.
    #5.4  
    I did not disturb him, but in the hope that tea would calm him, I collected some soothing herbs. With only the
    simplest of magic, I warmed him a cup of the ancient traditional brew.
    #5.5  
    Whilst I engaged in the process of gathering and mixing, then brewing, I pondered the strange elf and what might
    drive him to seek isolation in the Sacred Grove.
    #5.6  
    The pain he projected seem too deep for a man of lost fortune, or one of lost position. I could only imagine his lost
    to have been a person. A lost loved one...perhaps even a lost lover.    #5.7  
    Extending the cup to him,  I smiled with compassion. The man blinked up at me in surprise, as though I had
    appeared from the aether. He accepted with a somber smile.  "My sincere gratitude, friend."

    (a) I only smiled and left him in peace.    [[go to E3]]
    (b) "You are welcome, friend."  [[go to 5.8]]
    #5.8  
    The stranger did not seem to want to talk. He offered no name and said no more.
    #5.9  
    I sat with him for a time, offering no words, only my companionship. 
    #6.0  
    Eventually, I left him to contemplate in peace.  [[go to E3]]
    #6.1  
    This was troublesome, but not my business. I  focused harder on my meditations, and left them be.  Ignoring the
    intrusive emotions, I attempted to center my thoughts and focus on my own meditation. 
    #6.2  
    I sought my own peace. Little by little I pushed out the distraction. Once again, I was the center of my own world.
    [[END CAMPAIGN]]
    #7.1  
    How dare they invade my thoughts! I would find them and give them a piece of my mind.  Stomping through
    the Sacred Grove it did not take me long to find the source of the intrusive emotions.
    #7.2  
    A maudlin elf slumped against a tree, moping to himself and blasting his misery throughout the grove. The elf is
    older than myself, well dressed, so he is not some wounded hunter or lost farmer.    #7.3  
    Fine clothing, however, means fine education, which means he should know better than to project his misery upon
    other people's peace. Then again, perhaps he is just that miserable, to overlook such courtesy...

    (a) Leave him alone [[go to 8]] 
    (b) Demand that he stop [[go to 7.4]]
    [EPISODE TWO CONT.]


    #7.4  
    I firmly crossed my arms and grunted, "do you mind keeping it down?"
    "Oh..." The man blinked up at me in surprise, as though I had appeared from the aether.    #7.5  
    Light shimmered in his  eyes, damp with the want of tears that would not fall, be it out of strength or pride.  Those 
    woeful eyes hardened with sternness and he stood up. To say he towered above me was understating things.
    #7.6  
    "You should be more polite, young one."The man was clearly displeased. Aged, Elven eyes gleamed with an
    unnatural fire.
    #7.7  
    "I did not mean to be so brusque.  I am typically more gracious. But, your emotions were... invasive."
    #7.8  
    "I see..." Troubled by this revelation, the man offered a sincere apology before leaving the grove, "I am truly sorry
    to have disturbed your peace, young one. I shall leave you to meditate."
    #7.9  
    When he had gone, I had a strange sense, as though I were just pulled from the edge of falling into a great fire. [[go to E3]]
    #8.  
    I felt bad after all, and left him be before he saw I was there.  As I left I looked back, curious about this tragic
    (albeit annoying) man. I noticed him watching me. Damn... 

    [[END EPISODE]]







    EPISODE THREE
    #Location: Sacred Grove
    #1.  
    My return to the Sacred Grove had been intended to purge my mind of troublesome thoughts and the stresses
    weighing on my heart. Wandering into the cool emerald haven seemed to give such promise.
    #2.  
    Trailing my finger tips over the bark of the trees, some coarse and others smooth as silk, I counted them as I
    passed through their shade to find my Birth Tree.  So many gathered here like a protective family.
    #3.  
    I settled beneath my timber guardian. It towered above me as I meditated below, eyes closed and vulnerable.
    Although I tried to keep my mind clear, to focus on only the present, my thoughts drifted.
    #4.  
    At first it was simple distractions. The grass tickling my bare feet. A tickle of my hair on the edge of my ear.
    Eventually, however, my memories of that strange, sorrowful elf crept in to consume my every thought.
    #5.  
    Perhaps out of shame, he had shared nothing of his misery.  No more than his unintended emotional projections,
    that is.  I could have probed him for reasons, but that would have been rude.
    #6.  
    Still, I could not cease my curious conjecture, imagining all manner of scenarios. Childhood tales of curses and
    villains wove fantastical stories around the stranger, drowning out mundane (and far more likely) possibilities.
    #7.  
    "Ah, well..."I had given up on my meditation. I would likely never know, but my imagination had been 
    entertaining enough.    #8.  
    Standing up, I brushed loose grass from my clothing and set to return home.  As I started through the grove a
    flash of colour and movement drew my eye.    #9.  
    Headed in the direction I had found him before, was the stranger. So odd that I would think on him so long and
    then, here he is!
    #10.  
    (a) Observe from a distance  [[go to 11]]
    (b) Approach with good will  [[go to 15]]
    #11.  
    I crept closer to watch him. I don't want to be seen.  A hand gently caressed the Birth Tree that he had sat beneath
    before.  Although he still looks somber, it is not nearly so mournful.    #12.  
    After a moment, the man removed a delicate pipe from his fine coat and lit it.  As he leaned against the tree trunk,
    the man looked directly at me and nodded. "Do you intend to spy on my young one, or will you join me?"
    #13.  
    Well, that was mildly embarrassing. The highest points of my ears must have been pink, for I could feel them and
    my cheeks warm as I blushed.  Stepping out from behind the tree I walked toward him.
    #14.  
    "I did not mean to spy. After your upset before, I have been greatly concerned for you."I hoped I sounded both
    genuine and less childish than my behavior likely implied. [[go to 18]]
    #15.  
    Approaching with a smile, I raised a hand. "Hello. Strange, we meet again."  Although I had greeted him, the
    man watched me approach while preparing himself a pipe.    #16.  
    With a casual lean  upon the Birth Tree he took a gentle draw upon it, then nodded at me in greeting once I had 
    come near enough.    #17.  
    Uncertain what to think of his silence, I Made sure to be polite.  "Last time I had seen you, you were so upset...
    you seem better. I just thought I would inquire after your well being."    #18.  
    With a tilt of his head, the man observed me a moment before asking, "you are my Apsara then? Are you
    watching over me... secretly a guardian faerie disguised as a nosy young elf?"
    #19.  
    (a)  Joke - Yes [[go to 20]]
    (b)  Be honest - No  [[go to 21]]

    [EPISODE THREE CONT.]

    #20.  
    "Yes, that is it,"I winked with a laugh.  The man's eyes sparkled with mirth. Any misgivings or distrust between us   seemed to have dissolved. 
    #21.  
    "Well then, my  Apsara should know my name, yes? And I theirs? I am Tialas of Lyr-Taer."[[go to 23]]
    #22.  
    "No... just worried,"I was honest.  "Indeed,"he gave a sage nod and soft puff on his pipe. "Well then, little
    Apsara I am Tialas of Lyr-Taer. May I have the privilege of your name?"[[go to 23]]
    #23.  
    I made a polite half bow. "My name is [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]]."
    #24.  
    Tialas offered a bow of his own, tucking the pipe behind his back. "It is a great pleasure to meet you,  [[PLAYER
    CHARACTER NAME]]." He rose with a smile.
    #25.  
    After our introductions, Tialas suggested tea in the shade where we might watch the kaleidoscopes of butterflies
    over the meadow and talk at length. 
    #26.  
    Although I did not pry, nor indicate his restraint, I noticed that I was sharing far more information of myself than
    Tialas was offering up of himself.  By the time I did need to depart, I still knew very little of the man.

    [[END EPISODE]]




    EPISODE FOUR
    #Location: Sacred Grove

    #1.  
    As was my habit when my mind was restless, I ventured to the Sacred Grove. I should have gone to meditate. 
    My curiosity, however, was more demanding.
    #2.  
    Some time had passed since I had seen the elder elf, Tialas. Fanciful tales had wended their way into my
    daydreams and errant thoughts.
    #3.  
    An air of importance and power clung to him, like the mist on a lake. I felt it when near him, as well as his sorrow
    and that brief flash of anger; a fire I wished not to feel again.
    #4.  
    Rather than trek to my Birth Tree, I wandered toward Tialas's tree with six strands of flowering vines looped in my
    fingers.  Childhood years not ill-spent, I braided as I walked with little attention paid to my finger work.
    #5.  
    Each strand entangled another in a deft arrangement. By the time I emerged into the clearing by Tialas's tree, a 
    fine curved rope of fragrant blossoms had been tied.  The tree, however, stood alone. No Tialas.
    #6.  
    Disappointed he was not here, I heaved a sigh, but sat near the tree.  As I carefully finished the floral weave in my   hand and curled it around to tie it into a wreath a soft rustling caught my ear.
    #7.  
    Tialas emerged from the darker shadows of the wood and arched a brow as he approached. "Odd place for you to   loiter, 'not my Apsara'."    #8.  
    A subtle tease, or was he mocking me?
    (a) Give Tialas the wreath [[go to 9]]
    (b) Assert right to be there [[go to 9.2]]
    #9.  
    I presented the wreath, "I brought a gift for your tree-well, for you."
    #9.1  
    The man's features brightened. "A very kind gesture, but it is not my tree." When he saw my confusion, he      clarified,"this is my sister's Birth Tree." [[go to 10]]
    #9.2  
    I shrugged, but smiled, "it is your tree, but not your forest."    #9.3  
    A wary twitch narrowed his eyes. Tialas replied with an enigmatic tone. "Is it not?" I was not sure if he was teasing
    or threatening, but it was an odd response to be certain.
    #9.4  
    Seeing my discomfort, he relaxed his demeanor and approached. "It is, in fact, not my Birth Tree. It is my sister's
    Birth Tree." [[go to 10]]
    #10.  
    "Oh..."I felt a strange mixture of feelings, but primarily confusion. The tree was alive, so his sister was as well.
    There could be sickness or injury, or perhaps family matters, in which I best not meddle.
    #11.  
    It is not my place to pry after his personal matters, so I simply accepted this information in silence.    
    #12.  
    Recognizing that my awkward silence was out of respect, and I had no intention of prying, Tialas rest a hand on
    my shoulder. "It is alright, [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]], I am not ashamed to speak of it."
    #13.  
    "Did something happen to her? Is she not well?"    #14.  
    Tialas shook his head as he examined my decorative token.  "Alirienne...she is not ill.  We were very close, but..."
    He trailed off a moment.  I surmised he was carefully wording an explanation with which he was comfortable.
    #15.  
    "She left,"Tialas finished with little gravitas.  I could see this simple admission was difficult for him.
    #16.  
    I drew a delicate circle over the bark of the Birth Tree.  "She still lives, you see?  And clearly you miss her. Why
    not seek her out, reconcile your differences?" The man peered at me askance. "You would do this?"
    #17.  
    (a)  Encourage with sympathy  [[go to 18]]
    (b)  Taunt his cowardice [[go to 20]]
    [EPISODE FOUR CONT.]

    #18.  
    "Yes, I believe I would.  Is it not worth a try? Perhaps she is hurting just as much."I met his eyes with concern.
    #19.  
    After a respite, Tialas murmured, "you have given me much to think on, young one. I thank you."
    Positioning the flower wreath upon a small protrusion on the tree trunk, Tialas hung the gift, then departed.

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #20.  
    "If you really loved her, you would. Unless you are too afraid of rejection."I challenged his pride, a dangerous ploy
    for some men might react with rage or even violence. 
    #21.  
    "For one so young, you have rather bold notions of how to address one's elders,"Tialas's gaze was stern, but
    calm. "And you lack a subtle understanding of emotional complexity. We are not such simple creatures."
    #22.  
    "I meant no offense, sir."I hung my head.  "I simply meant that if you do not make the attempt, you will never
    know.  The only thing preventing you is your own fear of the unknowable."
    #23.  
    Tialas nodded at this. "True, and far more wise. You have given me much to think on, young one." In silence, he
    positioned the flower wreath upon a small protrusion on the tree trunk, then departed.

    EPISODE FIVE
    #Location: Sacred Grove

    #1.  
    Beneath the peach and gold gleam of dawn, I wandered amidst the dew dappled foliage and watched nature
    awaken to the day. A warren of rabbits lopped past me, pausing only to snuffle in my direction.
    #2.  
    I had come early to the grove, while the air was warming faster than the earth and mists swirled between the 
    Birth Trees giving it an otherworldly ambiance.
    #3.  
    Absently walking, my mind not present in my actions, I found myself again at Tialas's tree.  Well, at Alirienne's
    tree.  Strange that my subconscious brought me here.
    #4.  
    Each time before had been late day, so I did not anticipate encountering Tialas. 'Perhaps,' I thought, 'there would
    be no harm in meditating here just this once.'
    #5.  
    Settled beneath the overhanging boughs of Alirienne's Birth Tree, I eased myself into a centered pose, both
    relaxed and poised. 
    #6.  
    My spine was stretched upward as a string of pearls toward the sky, though the rest of me had melted into a
    placid state.
    #7.  
    At first my thoughts were focused on the sounds of the insects, but soon they too spirited away.  Tension faded
    and clarity expanded my being into a new sense of open awareness.
    #8.  
    I became more conscious of my surroundings and my own existence. My heartbeat, my breath, every sensation 
    on my skin felt more real.
    #9.  
    Again, I was bombarded by an emotion that was not mine. Sensation erupted within my head, panic that was both
    immediate yet seemed to come from leagues away, as if shouted across the universe.
    #10.  
    It was an expression of pure emotion, but unlike Tialas's invasive sorrow, this was thicker, more complex. Sorrow
    was not at the forefront, rather a frenzy of terror laced with rage, hopelessness and betrayal.
    #11.  
    Recovering from the initial shock, I refocus and attempted to find that centered calm again, that universal
    consciousness that opened my mind to hear her.
    #12.  
    Her? Was it a her, or a him? I was not sure, but that seemed to be the natural pronoun to flow to my thoughts. 
    A woman... perhaps a girl, certainly they seemed to be someone in need. It had been a desperate voice.
    #13.  
    As I focused I was only able to catch remnants, like the tattered hem of an ancient garment falling away in the
    apparition's wake.  Faint impressions, but no more than I had upon that initial assault.
    #14.  
    Weary from my effort, I rested back against the Birth Tree and lifted my eyes to watch the morning sun glitter in
    gold patches through the emerald leaves.
    #15.  
    Alirienne.  Could it have been her? Perhaps she thought that I was Tialas because I was at her tree.
    #16.  
    (a) Tell Tialas as soon as possible  [[go to 17]] 
    (b) Say nothing without certainty  [[go to 18]] 
    #17.  
    I would tell Tialas of this as soon as I was able. Any manner of menace could be threatening Alirienne.

    I did not know for certain it was her, and it was best not to alarm him. I chose to say nothing.        [[go to E8]]

    EPISODE SIX 
    #Location: Sacred Grove

    #1.  
    Perched cross-legged, I lounged upon a mossy rock at the edge of a meadow clearing.  My meditation long
    finished, I dallied now, an elf delighting in the passing birds.
    #2.  
    I surveyed a murmuration of starlings as it swarmed in and around the edge of the grove before up into the azure 
    sky. So many flocks with such aerial ballet.
    #3.  
    The illusion of order in the self-focused chaos was both beautiful and frantic, always on the precipice of disaster.
    It was a wonder that they never collided midair.
    #4.  
    As I sliced a sliver of apple from the core and slid it between my lips, I thought of the panicked voice that had
    reached out to me.  So much fear, and though I could understand no more, it was like frantic flailing in the wind.
    #5.  
    This was how we differed from the starlings. Although they screamed out to each other as well, wings flapping,
    there was little they could do to help one another, nor would they.  I, however, could do something.
    #6.  
    Pondering the natural order of altruism and compassion, I nibbled at my apple and stared out into the Sacred
    Grove.  My thoughts were disrupted only when a passing shadow wandered through the trees.
    #7.  
    I tossed the fruit off into the grass as I sheathed my dagger and slid off the rock. By the cut of the cloth and the 
    manner of the man, I was positive it was Tialas.
    #8.  
    Swift as I was able, I sprinted toward him and, of course, Alirienne's tree.  Breathless once I arrived, I heaved for
    air as he gaped at me in confusion.
    #9.  
    "By the Goddess, is the Sacred Grove on fire?"Tialas asked with only a weak attempt at mirth.
    #10.  
    "I didn't mean to startle you, but I had a frightening experience when I was here last. I do not know what to make
    of it." I took a few more calming breaths.  "May I ask you about Alirienne?  She could be in danger."    #11.  
    "What?!" Tialas stared at me in horror and confusion.  After all, why would I ask such a thing?  "Explain
    yourself."He only just controlled his emotion.
    #12.  
    "No, no, please... I just... I want to understand what happened. It might help explain my strange experience. 
    Please?" It was an awkward answer, but honest.
    [[CHARM CHECK:    + POINTS GO TO  13]]
    -- POINTS GO TO  33]]
    #13.  
    Still suspicious, Tialas seated himself, then related the story with a pained expression. "Alirienne was the 
    Archmage, but she and her husband... Dahenwar."He said the name with a peculiar, reverent tone.
    "They argued."
    #14.  
    "It wasn't my place to mediate, but I tried to council my sister. I pressed her to make peace with him."Tialas 
    pursed his lips and scowled. "Their quarrels were disruptive to the court. It was inappropriate for her position."
    #15.  
    He shook his head in misery. "I pushed her too hard, never tried to hear her side of things. I just wanted peace. 
    We argued. She said I was selfish and cared more about appearances than about her."
    #16.  
    "It wasn't true, of course,"he was insistent. "I love my sister... but YES, I was angry.  She wouldn't tell me what
    they argued about and refused to settle matters with Dahenwar. Then she just..."
    #17.  
    "Left,"I supplied when he was silent too long.  Tialas just nodded.  In the way you had become accustomed,
    Tialas grew quiet his jaw set with a stern grimace.
    #18.  
    The man's eyes locked on mine with an intimidating glower. "I think it is time you explain what this has to do with 
    your  'frightening experience', young one."
    #20.  
    I related what had happened, the sense of fear both near and far, but that I was unable to understand it at all. 
    "Could it have been Alirienne? This is her tree.  Maybe she was trying to reach out ... to you."
    [EPISODE SIX CONT.]

    #21.  
    Tialas's eyes quivered with emotion, hope perhaps, before he looked down at his hands. "I will relate this tale
    to the new Archmage. I believe he is better educated in such matters than you or I. He will know what to do."
    #22.  
    The new Archmage! Wasn't his name Dahenwar? Surely it was the same man, the name was far from common.
    "Although they are estranged, would Dahenwar not lend help? More than just advice?"
    #23.  
    In his thoughtful silence, I pointed out, "he did help look for her when she went missing, I'm sure."
    #24  A
    n uncomfortable coldness fell over Tialas's features as he met my gaze. "No. In fact, he refused...insisted she
    was merely seeking attention and would have no part of it."
    #25  (
    a)  Trust in Tialas's wisdom to do what is best [[go to 26]]
    (b)  Suggest Tialas not tell him [[go to 28]] 
    #26.  
    "Surely then, this proves that is not the case."My concern reflected Tialas's and it seemed clear to me that even
    Dahenwar had to see reason. "But I trust that you know what is best."
    #27.  
    Half bowing to you in reverence, Tialas spoke with sincerity. "I thank you for telling me this, [[PLAYER
    CHARACTER NAME]]." With absolute urgency, the man departed, offering no indication of his decision.
    [[go to E7]]

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #28.  
    "No!"I clapped a hand over my mouth. Gathering my poise, I more calmly pleaded, "Do you think that is wise?
    You said they fought. What if Dahenwar has harmed Alirienne? Telling him could endanger her more."
    #29.  
    Rubbing at his jaw in frustration, Tialas growled, "Damn! I wish I knew for certain!" The man bolted into a pace,
    looping back and forth in front of me as he pondered this dilemma.
    #30.  
    Some solution must have occurred to him without my help, for he suddenly stopped and faced me.  Taking both
    my shoulders, he pulled me to my feet.
    #31.  
    Tialas spoke with sincerity. "I thank you for telling me this, [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]]." With absolute
    urgency, the man departed, clearly distraught over such a sinister possibility.
    #32.  
    I hoped that I had made the right decisions and that, ultimately, all would be well.  [[go to E7]]

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #33.  
    Bristled by my question, Tialas drew a deep breath and tugged his jacket with a very curt reply. "My relationship 
    and past with Alirienne are family matters and rather personal. These incessant questions are inappropriate."
    #34.  
    Before I could utter an apology he pivoted and strode off, "I have less trivial things to engage my time. Good day."

    EPISODE SEVEN
    #Location: Sacred Grove

    #1.  
    A colder aura clung to the Sacred Grove. It was not a fog or mist, simply a dense air that chilled with a vicious
    nettle at my soul.  This was the land of Eternal Spring, it was never cold. Not like this. My sudden entry into such 
    a brisk ward was odd.
    #2.  
    Watching the squirrels circling the trees with carefree fervor, and the greenery bending to a light   breeze, 
    I determined it to be an unnatural cold. Perhaps, it was even an ague that only I felt, not a chill at all.
    #3.  
    Standing by my own Birth Tree, I felt a strange nudging, as if someone prompted me to keep walking.  Knowing
    better than to ignore such instinct, I obeyed and followed it's urging.
    #4.  
    A pale blue butterfly danced about me for a moment, then darted on ahead in its spasmodic flight leading me
    along a trail that I recognized would lead me to Alirienne's Birth Tree.
    #5.  
    Upon this realization, I surged ahead, out-pacing the butterfly and rushing to the spot only to come to a skidding
    halt.  My heart seized to just as abrupt a stop, and the air in my lungs went stale.
    #6.  
    Dry wood flaked, shedding bark along with browned and brittle leaves.  The dead tree expelled all light attempting
    to touch it.
    #7.  
    Rigid, devoid of life, it sat within a dim orb of absence, as if a globe of cimmerian shade had encapsulated the
    once lush plant.
    #8.  
    Sinking to my knees, my shoulders sagged. "Oh, Tialas." Poor, Tialas.   I wished I had been wrong, as wrong as
    anyone could have been.
    #9.  
    I had done all anyone could ask of me in an attempt to help, but I could not stifle my guilt. Perhaps I could have
    done more, acted faster, hunted Tialas down, not waited on chance, concentrated harder, heard her clearer.
    #10.  
    Self-beration and pity would not bring her back or mend failures. Hanging my head, I prayed to the Goddess for 
    Alirienne, for Tialas, that he may find peace in spite of her passing.
    #11.  
    Although I had only the most earnest sentiments toward Tialas, he and I never crossed paths in the Sacred Grove
    again.  I left a floral wreath beneath the tree whenever I happened by, so at least he knew I still thought of him.

    EPISODE EIGHT
    #Location: Sacred Grove

    #1.  
    Rich scents of spice and wood filled the forest glen, tangled with the wafting perfume of flowers bursting in full 
    bloom.  Colorful flourishes reached from between tall grasses and twists of vine. Some lay broken and scattered.
    #2.  
    Wending my way through the Sacred Grove, I collected the wildflowers trampled by deer and rabbits.  My slightly
    wilted bouquet was beautiful, perhaps only to me, but it was a final performance for the felled blossoms.
    #3.  
    I heard a familiar voice croon, "tending wounded flowers. You truly are an Apsara." Tialas stood near a tree,
    not far from me, his arms crossed as he watched me. The man looked stressed and sad.
    #4.  
    Greater appreciation comes in the absence of the things valued. Or so I have been taught. The time since last I
    had seen Tialas had, indeed, made me appreciate his conversation all the more.
    #5.  
    (a) Answer jokingly [[go to 6]]
    (b) Answer sympathetically  [[go to 9]]
    #6.  
    "I am not the one watching people,"I squinted over with a suspicious grin. Tialas chuckled. "True enough. Not 
    watching, in truth just passing by.  I was visiting Alirienne's tree one last time."
    #7.  
    "Last time?" I studied him with concern. "What has happened?"
    #8.  
    A reassuring hand rested upon my shoulder. "No, nothing tragic. I must return to the Capital City.  You recall my 
    home is Lyr-Taer?"[[go to 11]]
    #9.  
    Offering him the meek, wilting bouquet, I smiled.  "How are you friend?"    #10.  
    Regret dimmed his usually bright eyes. "It is time for me to go home. I have too much to attend to there to spend
    anymore time jaunting about in the country."
    #11.  
    "Oh, I see..." I did my best not to appear too disappointed.
    [[RELATIONSHIP CHECK:    + POINTS GO TO  13]]

    #12.  
    Tialas inclined his head with a smile and a renewed gleam to his eyes. "I was rather hoping you would find time to 
    visit Lyr-Taer... it would be nice to see you again."
    #13.  
    (a)  Yes, thank you  (friendly or romantic)  [[go to 14]]
    (b)  Maybe, maybe not  (also non-romance)  [[go to 17]]
    #14.  
    "Yes, that would be lovely. Thank you, Tialas."
    #15  S
    weeping into a deep bow, Tialas graciously thanked me. "I am very pleased to hear this, and I look forward to
    seeing you again in the capital."    #16.  
    I watched him leave, my mind already reeling at all of the wondrous sights that Lyr-Taer might hold for me, not the
    least of which would be Tialas.

    "I shall see what I can manage. I am a busy person."

    pleasure making your acquaintance, [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]]."

    Tialas swept into a measured half-bow, "until we meet again."

    With a courteous bow of my head, I concurred. "Indeed, such would be a merry day. Many blessings to you 
    Tialas."
    #22.  
    "And to you, young one." The man bowed with respect and, accepting the meager gift of my wilted flowers, set off
    for his home in Lyr-Taer.

    EPISODE NINE
    LOCATIONS: Lyr-Taer Capital City, Inn

    #1.  
    Splendor illuminated the city in colours so vibrant that I was certain the banners and lanterns could be seen for
    miles if not the heavens.
    #2.  
    Music swelled the air like a beating heart that jaunted to a different joyous beat as I passed from street to street.
    Each troupe of minstrels or merry group of friends reveled in different traditional tunes or drinking songs.
    #3.  
    Although a religious festival for some, the Sky Flower Festival, for many, as any celebration had become an
    excuse to imbibe and frolic, feast and embrace life with loved ones. Laughter was the order of the day.
    #4.  
    The legendary flower of the festival's origin was believed to have been a star plucked from the heavens by the
    Sky God himself; a gift for his beloved, the Goddess of Nature.
    #5.  
    Since as long as anyone could remember, kings and queens, adventurers and mages had hunted for the celestial 
    flower. Tales abounded of the flower having healing properties, or granting eternal life, wishes or ultimate power.
    #6.  
    Every year there was news of some hapless group or random fool fallen off a cliffside, or drown in a 
    bog, desperately hunting the kingdom's untouched, or inhospitable regions, convinced the Gods hid it there.
    #7.  
    As no one had ever found this nocturnal bloom, so very rare and lovely, most believed it a myth and the festival
    had taken on a far more superficial romantic reverie than its weightier holy genesis.
    #8.  
    The festival had become quite spectacular, especially once the sun set.  I anticipated the coming night of magical
    sky blooms, exploding visions of light cast by mages.
    #9.  
    The spells rocketed into the dark night, then burst. A moment they appeared as a flower, then would shower down
    about the crowd, ephemeral as faerie dust.
    #10.  
    Although I had not yet made plans for the festival itself, I had received a letter scripted upon fine
    parchment in an elegant calligraphy.  It looked to be a rather fancy invitation at first.
    #11.  
    Upon opening it, I saw the name at the bottom and saw the carefully inscribed signature of Tialas.

    [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]] I am pleased that you have come to Lyr-Taer for the Sky Flower Festival. I look
    forward to seeing you whilst you are here. I hope you will do me the honor of joining me this evening as my guest.
    #14.  
    If so, please wear the enclosed medallion on your collar and come to the Palace. All the finest food and
    spectacle of the faire shall be there, and if you come, the finest people too.
    #15.  
    I also took the liberty of sending you something to wear. The tailor said it will be the height of fashion. I look
    forward to seeing you in it, when you join me this evening. Sincerely yours ~Tialas
    #16.  
    I examined the small coin-like pendant. It was engraved with a flower, the symbol of the festival, no doubt. It must
    have been a proof of invitation to the private party, and now I was a guest as well. At the palace no less!
    #17.  
    (a) I must go!   (friendly or romantic)  [[go to 18]]
    (b) No, I won't.  (also non-romance) [[go to 20]]
    #18.  
    Of course I would go to a private party at the palace! He sent me such finely tailored clothing, and called me one
    of "the finest people." It was all rather flustering. I felt warm and distracted.
    #19.  
    Sunset would soon be here in full, so I had to get dressed and on my way. What I had intended to wear
    looked so pedestrian in comparison to Tialas's gift. I could not wait to put it on.  [[go to E9.5]]

    [EPISODE NINE CONT.]

    #20.  
    Although a private party at the palace was very likely a wonderful thing, it all sounded a bit pompous and I was 
    more than a little upset that Tialas presumed to buy me garments without speaking to me first.
    #21.  
    There were other ways to spend my evening. I could go to the Sky Blossom contest, or just enjoy the evening with   someone nice... who did not make decisions for me.
    [[IF AT THE INN GO TO 22]]

    I went downstairs and sought out Yandar who greeted me with a boisterous smile. "Hello, [[PLAYER
    CHARACTER NAME]]. Do you have big plans for tonight?"
    #25.  
    "Hi, Yandar. I had intended to meet up with an old friend, but not today, I think.  I'm not going to his... fancy party
    either." My scowl did not encourage questions.
    #26.  
    Yandar's smile wasn't as big, but he was still cheerful, "fancy parties are for fancy folks. Nothing wrong with   enjoying the simple pleasures of a simple life."
    #27.  
    "Would you like to watch the Sky blooms with me?" The man's invitation was genuine.
    #28.  
    "I was hoping you would want to. That would be lovely."I smiled with relief at his genuine friendship. "Say, what do   you think of my costume?"
    #29.  
    Giving me a good look over, Yandar then smiled, "I think you look very nice. Much more fancy than this plain 
    innkeeper, for certain."
    #30.  
    Feeling better, I followed Yandar out onto the porch of the inn where we could see the Sky Blooms when the

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #36.  
    I was looking forward to the Sky Flower Festival and seeing Tialas would be nice, but a party at the Palace... the
    idea made me feel awkward. Perhaps Tialas was showing off or, perhaps I just felt intimidated by the Royalty.


    [EPISODE NINE CONT.]

    #37.  
    Whatever the cause of my discomfort, I did not want to go.  Sending word that I would not come was a distressing 
    question and after a time I finally scribbled a note with a pleasant thank you but no excuse.
    #38.  
    Children crowded the streets so it did not take more effort than holding up a silver to find one willing to run the
    note to the palace gate.  Hopefully, Tialas would accept my regrets.  [[go to E10]]

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #39.  
    Surely most anyone I knew in the Capital City would already be enjoying the festival. Perhaps if I just wandered
    the street and took in the pageantry, I might happen upon someone. Or better, make a new friend.
    #40.  
    There were jugglers and fire-breathers, dancers and acrobats. Animals performed tricks while musicians played
    exotic music, and everywhere the air was rich with the rich aroma and spice of food.
    #41.  
    Children ran about with wind-flowers on sticks, while nimble-fingered women sold elegant embroideries of the 
    Skyflower, and young women made folded paper flowers scented with perfume.
    #42.  
    I had chosen not to go to the palace for an evening with Tialas, but when the first eruptions of glittering magic
    Sky Blossoms crackled above my head, I forgot all about his party. My eyes were alight with fire and wonder.

    #43.  
    Every year the festival held a contest for the most spectacular Sky Blossom spells.  There were various contests

    #44.  
    The contest categories and prizes differed from place to place and sometimes year to year, so it was always
    interesting to see what new might happen, not just what new spells may be cast.
    #45.  
    Making my way to the contest was not hard.  Small signs with arrows marked the street to lead the way. It was a 
    huge event and everyone was headed that way, like a river of people and I was a tiny fish.    #46.  
    A Crier in bright, motley garments stood atop a podium shouting, "LAST CALL FOR ENTRIES! HURRY 
    COMPETITORS! LAST CHANCE TO ENTER!"
    [[MAGES GO TO 47]]
    [[NON-MAGES GO TO 48]]
    #47.  
    (a) I just want to watch [[go to 48]]
    (b) I want to enter! [[go to 51]]
    #48.  
    There were mages from all over lined up and waiting to show off their skills, to compete for grandiose prizes to be
    given away by the Archmage Dahenwar himself! 
    #49.  
    Although some were younger than me, and others very old, everyone was incredibly skilled. As the sky grew dark   and the show began each was given their turn and no one disappointed the crowd.
    #50.  
    I had chosen not to go to the palace for an evening with Tialas, but when the first eruptions of glittering magic
    Sky Blossoms crackled above my head, I forgot all about his party. My eyes were alight with fire and wonder.

    Competing in the contest would be fun, but once I had entered, I began to feel a bit nervous. Everyone would be 
    watching me when it was my turn. What if I made a mistake?

    #53.  
    Although some were younger than me, and others very old, every one was incredibly skilled.  I would have to
    concentrate very hard to block out my anxiety and focus on my spell.
    #54.  
    As my turn grew nearer and I saw what the others were doing, I went over in my head what I would do. When the 
    Archmage Dahenwar came to me, I drew a breath and cast my spell.
    [[MAGIC CHECK  + GO TO 55]]
    -  GO TO 64]]
    #55.  
    I focused and cast a Sky Blossom spell for:
    (a) A Sky Flower {Dexterity check} {Intelligence – if no Dexterity Stat} [[MOST INTRICATE DESIGN PRIZE]]
    (b) A daisy chain {Charm check}  [[CROWD FAVOURITE PRIZE]]
    (c) A long-lasting rose {stamina check}  [[MOST ENDURING SPELL PRIZE]]

    {NOTE:  The Dexterity, Charm and Stamina visible to the player when choosing. This is what will determine if they win the contest.  The first check is simply if their spell is successful.}

    [[STAT CHECK    + GO TO 56a, 56b, 56c]]
    -  GO TO 61]]
    #56.  
    My spell succeeded beautifully! I opened my eyes and watched it burst into the air and could not help marveling at   my accomplishment with pride as the crowd oohed and cheered. 
    #57.  
    "Very lovely,"Dahenwar appraised before moving on to the next contestant.  It was a hand-wringing wait for the 
    judging, but I thought I had done well.
    #58.  
    Then it was time for the Awards! I listened with anticipation as the Archmage Dahenwar read through the winners
    for each category. And then suddenly, I heard my name!
    #59.  
    "And in the category for [[INSERT PRIZE BASED ON A,B,C]] the winner is [[PLAYER
    CHARACTER NAME]]!!" He led the crowd in applause as I was coaxed over to accept my prize.
    #60.  
    For the entire evening I could not stop blushing at all the praise and was still stunned that I had won! It was such 
    a wonderful feeling. The prize really mattered so little in comparison. [[go to 62]]
    #61.  
    Although my spell was beautiful and everyone praised me for it after the contest, I did not win.  I was fine with not
    winning.  I had competed against excellent mages and still done very well. It was a worthy accomplishment.
    [[go to 61]]
    #62.  
    After the contest, the elder mages put on a show for everyone that surpassed anything that I had made. The
    reprieve from attention was nice, and I was able to enjoy the show too.
    #63.  
    I could not imagine that the festival could have been any more wonderful than this! Memories like these were
    worth more than any prize.  [[go to E10]]

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #64.  
    My spell could not have gone more wrong.  Archmage Dahenwar had to duck as my Sky Blossom spell soared
    through the crowd like an angry bee made of fire!
    #65.  
    I think one of the elder mages cast a water spell to douse it, or maybe someone just threw a bucket at it, because 
    I heard a splash, then a fizzle.  I did not see because I was covering my head and face in humiliation.
    #66.  
    A soft cough caused me to part my fingers and peek. Archmage Dahenwar eyed me and advised sternly, "perhaps   you should practice harder before casting spells in public... or EVER AGAIN."
    #67.  
    "Y-yes, Archmage,"I squeaked in mortification.  I did my best not to flee or shrink into a corner to cry in shame.      Later it became harder not to run or cry as I saw people laughing and pointing me out to those who missed it.

    [EPISODE NINE CONT.]
    #68.  
    At least everyone would have a great story to tell. It was exciting... even if it was humiliating, but now I wish I'd
    gone to Tialas's party. Too late for that, I supposed.   [[go to E10]]

    EPISODE NINE .  FIVE        
    LOCATIONS: Lyr-Taer Palace, Private Garden


    #1.  
    The medallion on my collar was, as I had guessed, an invitation of sorts. It seemed almost like a magical token
    making me nobility for a night. Strangers curtsied and guards stepped aside.
    #2.  
    Wandering the lovely palace ball I sampled the sugared fruits and delectable candies. Wine, richer than any I had
    ever tasted, was quick to make me heady, so I had no more than a few sips before setting the goblet aside.
    #3.  
    A discordant exclamation of excitement rose and soon found harmony in synchronous 'oohs' and 'aahs' as the sky
    blooms began to pop and crackle against the stars.
    #4.  
    Light pressure from fingertips brushed my elbow. I turned to see Tialas smiling down at me.  "I am pleased that
    you came.  I feared you wouldn't."
    #5.  
    Still amazed that he had invited me to the palace, I floundered a moment for what to say. Remarking on his 
    importance could seem like flattery, but it would let him know I was impressed, but then, I might seem superficial.
    #6.  
    (a) Compliment his importance  [[go to 7]]
    (b) Pretend not to be impressed    [[go to 9]]  [[ -- romance points?]]
    #7.  
    "Of course I came. A party at the palace?"A radiant showering of pale purple stardust fell around us like 
    descending fireflies. "You must know some important people to enjoy such events."
    #8.  
    Tialas's smile was wry, but I could see he held something back.  Realizing my implication I stammered to add, "not
    that you are not important. I am certain you are."   [[go to 12]]
    #9.  
    Playing coy as though I had attended dozens of such events, I inclined my head and smirked, "I considered not
    coming. Affairs like these can be so stuffy."
    #10.  
    "Indeed they can,"Tialas commiserated with a knowing nod, although he was noticeably put off by my lack of 
    excitement.  "We can count on each other's company, however, to keep things lively, yes?"
    #11.  
    I narrowed my eyes, as I scrutinized him closely. "I suppose a man with invitations to the palace is interesting
    enough to hold my attention." To show that my remark was in jest, I winked.    [[go to 12]]
    #12.  
    "Something like that,"he chuckled before changing the subject. "You look quite wonderful. Is this on my account?"
    #13.  
    (a) Oh, yes    (romance) [[go to 14]]
    [[IF LACKING ENOUGH ROMANCE POINTS AFTER #9-11 TO CONTINUE ROMANCE GO TO 55]]
    (b) Not at all  (avoid romance) [[go to 40]]
    #14.  
    The apples of my cheeks and tips of my ears were warm, so undoubtedly pink as well. "Yes. You approve then?"
    #15.  
    Tialas did not answer then, but took my hand. Weaving through the crowd, I was led off toward a long empty hall 
    that ended at an elegant glass door.  The guards on either side nodded at us as we passed through.
    #16.  
    The other side opened up into an intimate and ornate private garden.  The guards closed the gate behind us and
    stood in front, blocking it from other guests.
    #17.  
    I felt a distinct warmth come to my cheeks again as I turned back to Tialas.  The intimacy of the garden was no
    longer due to its smaller size or its more enclosed structure. 
    #18.  
    "I want to show you something."He was speaking to me, but only glanced over his shoulder briefly as he led me 
    through the hanging ivy and weeping willows.  I followed with heart pounding.
    #19.  
    Above us, the sky flowers were still bursting, illuminating the garden in flashes of pink, blue, yellow, a rainbow of
    light.  When an eruption of blinding white alighted the garden like daylight, Tialas came to a halt.


    [EPISODE NINE .  FIVE CONT.]

    #20.  
    "Here,"his voice was a whisper.  A stone pedestal arranged with reverence like an altar sat amidst carefully
    arranged landscaping with a small spiral path leading toward it on a slight incline. 
    #21.  
    The pedestal held a large ornate bowl within which grew a solitary flower so lovely and strange, to my eyes it may 
    have been THE Sky Flower.  Its petals illuminated from within, or perhaps the wine had gone to my head.
    #22.  
    I walked the miniscule path to it to stare at the blossom. Rubbing at my eyes, I blinked and looked closer as it
    unfurled. The reaction of the flower seemed attuned to my presence, as if it opened just for me.
    #23.  
    Tialas leaned in near me. "I wanted to thank you,"His breath was warm against my neck. "For your kindness and 
    friendship. For listening."
    #24.  
    I turned to him, "You needn't tha--"  Tialas's mouth stopped mine with a kiss.
    #25.  
    (a) Return the kiss (romance) [[go to 26]]
    (b) Pull Away (end romance) [[go to 34]]
    #26.  
    I gave in to the tenderness of his kiss and stepped closer as Tialas encircled my waist with his arm.  Gentle and
    cautious, his other hand rose to cradle my cheek.
    #27.  
    Cheering and applause rose from the far side of the hedgerow and though I knew it to be for the Mage's sky
    bloom spells, in my mind, it had been for us as my heart erupted with the same light and energy.
    #28.  
    "You surprise me, Young One... my little Apsara... [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]]"Tialas whispered against 
    my cheek.  "I was afraid you would think me too old for you."
    #29.  
    "I'm an Apsara, remember?"I poked fun at his own nickname for me with a wink. "We are eternal; never born,
    never die... so I am much older than you."
    #30.  
    As he smiled, I looked back at the flower, mesmerized by its ethereal glow.  "Is it the real Sky Flower?"
    #31.  
    "Possibly... it is the only one of its kind..." Strong arms wrapped around me and Tialas rest his head beside      mine. "It can be our Sky Flower."
    #32.  
    A blush crept over me again and I felt my heart flutter. "I would like that,"I whispered in return.
    #33.  
    We spent the remainder of the evening in quiet conversation and laughter before he escorted me back to my
    lodgings. Neither of us wanted to think about the festival ending.

    [[END EPISODE]]
    #34.  
    With a quick jolt I stepped back and wiped my mouth. I gaped a moment, then shook my head and calmed myself.   "I'm sorry... I think I gave you the wrong impression, Tialas."
    #35.  
    The man carried himself with grace, but I could see the embarrassment in his eyes, for which I felt terrible.  "No,   no... it was my mistake. I misread things. Please, [[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]], forgive me."
    #36.  
    "There is nothing to forgive,"I assured him. "Really Tialas, it was nothing, just a mistake. I am flattered, honestly."
    #37.  
    Tialas was not comforted. Clearing his throat, he straightened and bowed with a rather formal posture. "I should 
    return to the party. Please, enjoy yourself as long as you like."
    #38.  
    "Tialas..."Pleading was all I knew to do, but it was not enough.  He departed with long, quick strides in spite of my
    following him. A solitary guard ducked into the garden to watch me.
    #39.  
    The incident took the festive winds from beneath my sails, and I decided to make my way through the boisterous
    nobles then the rowdy streets of commoners to head back to my bed. I did not feel like partying anymore. 

    [[END EPISODE]]
    [EPISODE NINE .  FIVE CONT.]

    #40.  
    "Well, I do try to look my best... but, no I didn't really make a special effort."I copped a crooked grin which quickly 
    began to fade as I watched Tialas's expression sour.
    #41.  
    Tialas was a bit curt, but smiled, "of course. You are a fine looking individual, the clothes only emphasize this fact."  The man averted his gaze and seemed to look for a way to divert the conversation, his manner, awkward.
    #42.  
    "It was lovely of you to invite me, Tialas!" I beamed a smile and indicated the sky blooms above,"the mage spells 
    are spectacular! How lucky you are to have an invitation to such a wonderful party to see them so close."
    #43.  
    "Oh, well... yes, it was nothing." Tialas seemed confused or as though there were more to say, but before I could 
    ask a bubbly young man came by with a tray piled high with puffy desserts. I snatched one to try.
    #44.  
    "Are you having a pleasurable time, then?"Tialas shouted above the booming of the light explosions, leaning 
    closer so I might hear him.
    #45.  
    "I LOVE IT!"I shouted back with a burst of laughter as a gaggle of drunkards nearly collapsed us into a punch 
    bowl. "Maybe not as much fun as them, but yes, I am having much fun! Thank you for inviting me!"
    #46.  
    Tialas touched my shoulder. I swore a faint shadow of disappointment passed over his face before he smiled 
    again and hollered, "Excellent! Carry on then! I am so glad you came!"
    #47.  
    As he slipped quickly through the crowd, I thought it odd that he invited me only to say hello. I had anticipated
    spending the festival evening together, having drinks and laughs. I must have wounded him somehow.
    #48.  
    (a) Pursue him    [[go to 49]]
    (b) Forget it and party  [[go to 53]]
    #49.  
    I tried to find Tialas again to ask him what was wrong, but I could not find him. Asking after him only garnered me 
    snide laughter, I was ignored or told to "move along."
    #50.  
    Wandering away from the bulk of the party, the frivolity and raucous nobles, I stumbled on a long empty hallway
    that led to an elegant glass door.
    #51.  
    "[[PLAYER CHARACTER NAME]]? What are you doing?"Tialas's voice echoed down the hall. I turned to face
    him with relief.
    #52.  
    "Looking for you, in fact."My tone was somber, but I held his gaze. "I feel awful for being so careless with your 
    feelings like that. I should have realized--"
    #52.5  
    "Think no more of it. Let us not damage our friendship with such fixations." He offered a forgiving smile.  "Come, 
    I want to show you something."Stepping past me, Tialas waved me to follow him through the large glass door. 
    [[go to 58]]
    #53.  
    I could go after him, but with so many people present, there was no guarantee that I would find him.
    #54.  
    I would try to see Tialas again before I left if I could. I could not do anything more than that, so I returned to the
    party and tried to enjoy myself. It truly was magnificent. 

    [[END EPISODE]]

    #55.  
    The apples of my cheeks and tips of my ears were warm, so undoubtedly pink as well. "Yes. You approve then?"
    #56.  
    "It suits you."Tialas appraised. His response lacked the romance and intimacy that I had expected. It felt cordial,
    but no more than a compliment from a friend. Perhaps I had misjudged his feelings for me.
    #57.  
    "I want to show you something."Tialas gestured for me to follow.  He led me off   toward an empty hall and an
    elegant glass door.  The guards on either side nodded at us as we passed through.
    [EPISODE NINE .  FIVE CONT.]

    #58.  
    The other side opened up into an ornate and finely tended garden.  The guards closed the gate behind us and 
    stood in front, blocking it from other guests.
    #59.  
    He only glanced over his shoulder briefly as he led me through the hanging ivy and weeping willows.  Above us,
    the sky flowers were bursting, illuminating the garden in flashes of pink, blue, yellow, a rainbow of light.    #60.  
    When an eruption of blinding white lit the garden like daylight, Tialas came to a halt. "Here."He directed my
    attention to the garden's centerpiece. "I wanted to thank you for your kindness and friendship. For listening."    #61.  
    A stone pedestal arranged with reverence like an altar, sat amidst carefully arranged landscaping.  A small spiral
    path led toward it on a slight incline. 
    #62.  
    The pedestal held a large ornate bowl within which grew a solitary flower so lovely and strange, to my eyes it may 
    have been THE Sky Flower.  Its petals illuminated from within, or perhaps the wine had gone to my head.
    #63.  
    I walked the miniscule path to it to stare at the blossom. Rubbing at my eyes, I blinked and looked closer as it
    unfurled. The reaction of the flower seemed attuned to my presence, as if it opened just for me.
    #64.  
    I turned to him with a gentle grin, "You needn't thank me. I would like to think you would have done the same for
    me. That is friendship is it not?"
    #65.  
    "Indeed it is."Tialas agreed and shrugged. "Regardless, kindness should be rewarded. Very few people are
    allowed to this garden or near this blossom."
    #66.  
    As he smiled, I looked back at the flower. "Is it the real Sky Flower? The Archmage and the King would have told 
    us if it had been found, wouldn't they?"
    #67.  
    "Possibly... it is the only one of its kind..." Tialas's voice grew quiet a moment, then he added, "If this is the only
    one, perhaps it is kept secret to keep it safe."
    #68.  
    "That makes sense,"I nodded as I considered the damage that could be done by power-hungry people, or even
    just over-zealous devotees desperate to see or touch it.
    #69.  
    We spent the remainder of the evening in joyful conversation and laughter before he escorted me back to my
    lodgings for the night. The festival had been quite wonderful and I thanked Tialas for his gift and invitation.

    EPISODE TEN           
    LOCATIONS: Sacred Grove


    #1.  
    Upon my return to the grove, I could not dismiss the feeling that I should go to Alirienne's tree and try to listen
    once more. Even if it was not her, someone needed help.
    #2.  
    If it was not her, how they were able to reach out through her tree, I could not fathom, but, it was inconsequential.
    The notion only convinced me further that it must, in fact, be Tialas's sister.
    #3.  
    I paused a moment at my own tree to center my thoughts and calm my energy so I could better focus on my task
    ahead.  Once I felt prepared, I made my way to the woman's Birth Tree.
    #4.  
    Settling cross-legged at the base of the trunk, I rest my hands with reverence upon the bark and closed my eyes.
    I, not only slipped into a meditative state, but reached out with my magic into the aether.
    [[MAGIC CHECK  +  GO TO 5]]
    -   GO TO 15]]
    #5.  
    Then a voice that was not mine erupted within my head speaking words that had no meaning, in a tongue that 
    had no language. Unlike the previous impressions of emotion, this was audible. It was a voice.
    #6.  
    The shock of it nearly jolted me so that my fingers almost slipped from the tree bark. Remembering myself, I
    gripped tighter and focused harder, trying to make sense of the verbal connection.
    #7.  
    {{HhhheEEeeeLLlll...pP}}  The metaphysical voice came is distorted bursts, drawn and echoing, like an instrument
    made to sound as if it could speak, a wholly unnatural sound.  {{Hhhhelp}}
    #8.  
    "Where are you?"My mind was exploding with the implications of having made contact with an unknown spirit.
    "Who are you? How can I help?!"The desperation in my response, I prayed was not too forceful as to scare her.
    #9.  
    Such worries were wasted, however.  It seemed that the non-corporeal being could not even hear me as over an 
    over she repeated, {{Hhhhelp! Hhelp! Help! HELP!}}    #10.  
    I noticed that it was becoming clearer, more coherent. So I tried my questions again.  "Where are you? How can I 
    help you?  Who are you? Can you hear me?!"
    #11.  
    {{Can you hear me?}}  I thought it echoed me at first until the woman's voice replied again. {{You--... you can hear 
    me? Who are you? Help me! HELP M--}}
    #12.  
    "Hello?  HELLO?!  Can you still hear me?!" I kept calling and yet, somehow I knew instinctively that she could not.
    Something had cut the connection between us.    #13.  
    It had been so abrupt, my hope was that it had not been danger or tragedy.  I would have persisted in trying to
    reconnect, but I was far too exhausted already.  I would have to try again another day.
    #14.  
    There was no doubt now that connection could be made.  If I could make a connection again, perhaps I could find
    her and help her. At least she had some hope now to help her persevere.  That was something. 
    #15.  
    At least an hour or more must have passed, judging by the shift of the sunlight through the trees.  No matter my
    efforts, a connection was never made.
    #16.  
    Disappointment and a sense of failure weighted on my shoulders.  Perhaps I could return and try again when my 
    skills had improved, or bring a magic token to help amplify my magic and strengthen any possible connection.
    #17.  
    Dusting off my clothes I stood and left the grove with far less of a sense of accomplishment than I had hoped.

    #Plot by Katja Alexeeva

    #Script by Alex De-Gruchy




    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is afternoon and there are currently no customers in the room, only Player-Character (PC) and Yandar. PC is wiping a cloth across the surface of a table while Yandar stands behind the counter. The room is illuminated by the daylight that enters through the windows.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was the middle of the afternoon and the Golden Meadow Inn was oddly quiet for the time of day – it was certainly the emptiest I'd seen it since I'd started working there."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The job was fine: decent pay, manageable hours, simple tasks. And Yandar was a helpful and easygoing boss. All in all, I'd enjoyed my time at the inn so far."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Although I didn't mind it when things were quiet, not being busy with customers and business in general led to Yandar filling the silence with talk. He had a lot of tales to tell after years of mingling with the people of Lyr-Taer on a daily basis."
    #4. 
    player_narration "As I cleaned the table before me while Yandar stood behind the counter, I glanced over at him just in time to see him reach into one of his pockets and pop a hardboiled sweet into his mouth."

    #29. 
    yandar "It has its moments. Anyway, stay here long enough and I'm sure you'll experience a few of your own. Especially when I teach you how to work the counter, you'll be on the front line then."

    player_narration "Moving lightly on my own feet so as not to be heard by whoever was approaching, I swiftly stepped back over to the counter and took my place behind it once more."

    #● PC walks away from the stairs and resumes his position behind the counter.
    #8. 
    player_narration "I stared down at the open pages of the guest register as if absorbed by what was written there, while in truth my attention was focused on the feet I heard approaching the top of the stairs and then descending them."
    #9. 
    player_narration "As the owner of those feet came into view, I glanced over and frowned in surprise when I saw who it was: the masked lyrian I'd seen talking to Yandar only recently."
    #10. 
    player_narration "I hadn't even realised he was in the building, but now he was certainly keen to leave – without turning his head to look at me or anyone else, he stormed over to the exit, shoved it open and then was gone."

    #● Melas appears at the top of the stairs, descends them and then leaves the inn.
    #11. 
    player_narration "When I'd last seen him, the masked lyrian and Yandar had certainly seemed serious and tense in their discussion, but there hadn't been any outright hostility. I wondered what this argument had been about."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Once again I stepped out from behind the counter and crossed the floor to the bottom of the stairs."

    #● PC walks out from behind the counter and over to the foot of the stairs. Yandar appears at the top of the stairs, looking down them.
    #13. 
    player_narration "I looked up to see Yandar standing at the top of the stairs, facing them and looking down at the ground floor below. His hands were clenched into fists down at his sides and his expression was thunderous."
    #14. 
    player_narration "As I came into view, our eyes met. His expression didn't lighten – he didn't even really seem to see me, his mind apparently clouded by anger. As curious as I was about what had happened, he was clearly in no mood for prying."
    #15. 
    player "Are you alright? I heard shouting."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Yandar stared at me for a few seconds. I partly expected him to yell at me to mind my own business and get back to work..."

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is morning, the room illuminated by the daylight that enters through the windows. There are a few customers seated around the room, drinking, eating and talking. Player-Character (PC) stands behind the counter.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It had been a quiet morning in the Golden Meadow, but when I spotted Lathien the bard descending the stairs, I assumed it wouldn't stay that way for much longer."
    #2. 
    player_narration "He'd stayed longer than his original three months but now Lathien's time at the inn had come to an end – at least, it had if he didn't make another up-front payment today."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I'd seen quite a bit of Lathien during his stay as he often spent time downstairs, eating, drinking, reciting poems and singing songs, and flirting with nearly every lyria – and the occasional lyrian – who walked through the door."
    #4. 
    player_narration "On more than one occasion he'd tried to keep the party going, trying to convince Yandar to keep serving booze until the early hours of the morning..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...but Yandar always refused, insisting that he was running a respectable business. Lathien and his friends and hangers-on would then stumble out of the inn and off to somewhere they could get more drinks."
    #6. 
    player_narration "After these heavy nights, Lathien would usually rise late in the afternoon with a pounding head and queasy stomach. Yandar and I had little sympathy for him, and weren't above teasing him when he was suffering one of his hangovers."
    #7. 
    player_narration "In the time I'd known him, Lathien had often been as prideful and oblivious as he had been during our first meeting, but he wasn't a bad sort, just someone who was perhaps best taken in small doses."

    #● Lathien descends the stairs and steps off them.
    #8. 
    player_narration "When Lathien reached the bottom of the stairs, I expected him to turn and walk in my direction and either tell me he was checking out or paying to stay longer."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Instead, the bard carried on without breaking his stride, ignoring the rest of the room completely and heading straight for the front door."

    #● Lathien walks to the exit but then stops before it.
    #10. 
    player_narration "Since I needed to know whether he planned on staying longer or not, I wasn't going to let him just leave without a word."
    #11. 
    player "Lathien?"
    #12. 
    player "Lathien!"
    #13. 
    player_narration "Although I was sure he heard me the first time I called out his name, only at the second time did Lathien stop, one hand on the handle of the front door."
    #14. 
    player_narration "He turned his head in my direction, briefly – and unconvincingly – feigned surprise, and then armed himself with his usual charming grin."
    #15. 
    lathien "Ah, [PLAYER NAME]! Sorry, I didn't see you there."
    #16. 
    lathien "I was just on my way out – I'll catch you later, alright?"
    #17. 
    player "Actually, the most recent payment you made took you up to last night but that's it. You either have to check out today or make another payment."
    #18. 
    player_narration "Lathien shifted uncomfortably for a moment, even as his smile remained in place on his face. Eventually he took his hand off the front door and crossed the room, coming to a stop before me."

    #● Lathien walks over to the counter and stands before PC.
    #19. 
    lathien "Are you sure about that? I thought I had another week left."
    #20. 
    player "I'm sure. It's all here in the guest register."
    #21. 
    lathien "Maybe you wrote it down wrong?"
    #22. 
    player "It's not wrong. Today's the day. Are you checking out or would you like to make another payment?"
    #23. 
    player_narration "Lathien placed an elbow on the counter and leaned in towards me slightly, glancing around the room before his eyes fixed on mine."
    #24. 
    lathien "Listen, you shouldn't be worrying that pretty little head about such trivial nonsense, especially on a beautiful day like today."
    #25. 
    lathien "You and I, we're both young and beautiful and talented. We don't have time to waste on boring old details and other unimportant things. They're beneath us. I know you understand what I'm saying."
    #26. 
    lathien "So why don't you forget about all this rubbish? I'll just carry on staying in my room like I have been, at least for a little while longer, and if Yandar asks then you can tell him I've paid for it. Just jot it down in your book there."
    #27. 
    lathien "What do you say, eh? I've learned a thing or two about life in my time, you know – you'd do well to listen to me on this."
    #28. 
    player_narration "I stared at Lathien in silence for a moment and then couldn't help but shake my head and chuckle. The bard had some gall, he really did..."
    #29. 
    player "Are you serious? Has anyone ever actually fallen for that?"
    #30. 
    player_narration "Lathien shrugged, still smiling."
    #31. 
    lathien "You'd be surprised. It was worth a shot."
    #32. 
    player "I'm sorry, but you either put more money on this counter or you check out. Those are your choices."
    #33. 
    player_narration "The smile on Lathien's lips faltered but didn't disappear completely. He frowned slightly for a few seconds and then redoubled his efforts."
    #34. 
    lathien "Alright. Alright, I'll make you a deal. An offer, actually – a generous one."
    #35. 
    lathien "How about this: you let me stay here for another week, maybe two, and you tell Yandar that I've paid for it..."
    #36. 
    lathien "...and in return, I'll perform for you – a private show for you and a few guests of your choosing. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that some people would kill for such an opportunity."
    #37. 
    player "Lathien, whenever I'm working and you're drinking and singing and reciting in here, I get a show. I've heard all of your songs and poems dozens of times already. So that offer's not as tempting as you might think."
    #38. 
    player_narration "Lathien raised an eyebrow suggestively as he leaned in a little closer."
    #39. 
    lathien "We could always make it a very private show – just you and me...?"
    #40. 
    player "I don't think so."
    #41. 
    lathien "You don't know what you're missing..."
    #42. 
    player "I'll do my best to live with that."
    #43. 
    player_narration "Lathien's smile finally disappeared as he stood up straight and looked down at the counter with a thoughtful frown. He tapped his chin with one index finger several times and then looked at me."
    #44. 
    lathien "I don't have my purse on me now but give me an hour. My things are still in my room, just leave everything as it is for now – I'll get some money and then I'll be back."
    #45. 
    player "Sorry, but Yandar has his rules..."
    #46. 
    lathien "Just one hour, maybe less. If you see Yandar before I return, pass on what I said and tell him not to worry, and that I'll make it worth his while."
    #47. 
    player_narration "I was about to tell Lathien that I really couldn't hold his room for him, but before I could get the words out, he turned and walked hurriedly to the front door."

    #● Lathien walks over to the front door.
    #48. 
    lathien "[PLAYER NAME], you're a saint! You won't regret this! See you in an hour! "

    #● Lathien opens the front door and exits the inn.
    #49. 
    player_narration "Lathien's final words were barely out of his mouth before he closed the front door after him and was gone. I wondered if I'd actually see him return within the hour. He was far from the most reliable lyrian in the world."
    #50. 
    player_narration "Yandar was currently out on an errand – I wondered what his reaction would be if he returned before Lathien did."
    #51. 
    player_narration "Lathien may have been irresponsible and vain, but even so, I wasn't keen on the idea of throwing his possessions out into the street if Yandar deemed it necessary."
    #52. 
    player_narration "One thing was for sure: if Lathien couldn't pay for his room any longer, my evenings at work were going to become a lot quieter. "

    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is afternoon, the room illuminated by the daylight that enters through the windows. The inn is currently busy, the room filled with people drinking, eating and talking. At one end of the counter, Player-Character (PC) is serving a middle-aged lyrian, the two facing each other across the counter. At the opposite end of the counter, Yandar is talking to Melas – Yandar is behind the counter while Melas stands in front of it.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was a busy morning at the Golden Meadow when the lyrian in the mask once again appeared. He'd entered the room and headed straight for Yandar, who was working the counter with me."
    #2. 
    player_narration "As I served a customer, I watched the masked lyrian out of the corner of my eye. He received glances from a few customers, none of whom looked for long. As far as I could tell, he didn't look in my direction."
    #3. 
    player_narration "When Yandar looked up from what he was doing and spotted the lyrian, his smile fell away. He told me to handle things for a moment, then he walked away from me and over to the far end of the counter, where he met the masked lyrian."
    #4. 
    player_narration "And now the two of them were standing there, talking in low voices, their expressions serious."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Determined not to let this opportunity go to waste, I excused myself to the lyrian I was currently serving and took a few steps in Yandar's direction, moving to fiddle with a tray and some mugs as if I needed them for something."

    #● PC moves halfway along the counter, in Yandar's direction.

The room is empty of customers, although Yandar is behind the counter and Player-Character (PC) stands just inside the doorway that connects the main room to the rest of the inn.

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is early morning, the room illuminated by the daylight that enters through the windows. The room is empty of customers, although Yandar and Player-Character (PC) are currently in the room, sitting at opposite ends of one table, facing each other.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was early in the morning at the Golden Meadow, early enough that the doors were not yet open for customers, and the handful of current guests were still in bed."
    #2. 
    player_narration "I'd been awake for a while, preparing the breakfast which I'd told Yandar I was going to make for the two of us that morning."
    #3. 
    player_narration "He'd asked why, and I said I wanted to show off some of the culinary skills I'd picked up from him during my time working at the inn."
    #4. 
    player_narration "It wasn't a lie, but it also wasn't my primary motive. What I really wanted to do was finally confront Yandar about the trouble he was in."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Yandar and I sat at a table together in the main room as we ate and drank, talking little, although the silences were comfortable ones. Eventually we finished and put down our cutlery."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Yandar sat back in his chair, patted his stomach with one hand and grinned at me."
    #7. 
    yandar "Well, [PLAYER NAME], you outdid yourself. That was delicious, thank you. Although you do realise I'm too full to move out of this chair now and won't be able to reach the front door to open for business today."
    #8. 
    player "Don't look at me. I'm just as stuffed as you are."
    #9. 
    yandar "It's good to know you've been paying attention to my culinary genius while working here, anyway."
    #10. 
    player "I think "genius"might be pushing it. "Mild competence", maybe?"
    #11. 
    player_narration "Yandar laughed and then the two of us settled into another brief but comfortable silence, one eventually broken by Yandar."
    #12. 
    yandar "So... what was all this really in aid of?"
    #13. 
    player "What do you mean?"
    #14. 
    yandar "Come on, I know there's something on your mind. I have noticed it, you know. And with how much you've fattened me up, I'm not going anywhere for the time being. So spill it."
    #15. 
    player_narration "So I did. I told Yandar I was worried about him, listing all of the things I'd seen and heard which had given me cause to worry, starting at the beginning and working my way up to today."
    #16. 
    player_narration "I mentioned Yandar's dark moods, his lying and sneaking around, his obvious money worries, his dealings with Melas and Lathien."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Yandar listened in silence throughout, frowning. But his troubled expression turned to one of outright annoyance when I came to my recent encounter with Melas, and what the masked lyrian had told me..."
    #18. 
    player_narration "...although it seemed to be an annoyance directed more at Melas than myself. But still he said nothing while I neared the end of everything I wanted to say."
    #19. 
    player "So there it is. I know you're in trouble, Yandar – I want to know what it is and I want to help, whether you think it's a good idea or not. I can't just stand by and do nothing while all this is going on."
    #20. 
    player "If the situation is as serious as I think it is then there's a good chance I could get caught up in it anyway, given how much time I spend here and around you. So don't you think it's better for me to know? Don't you think I deserve to know?"
    #21. 
    player "Whatever it is, you can trust me. I hope you know that."
    #22. 
    player_narration "I was done. I fell silent and waited. Yandar stared down at the surface of the table between us, a thoughtful frown on his face. Several seconds passed, the silence far from comfortable now."

    #23.3.
    player_narration "Not knowing what to say to that revelation, I said nothing. Yandar's expression remained troubled, although I hoped he'd continue talking now that he'd started. "#(GO TO 23.4.)
    #23.4.
    yandar "I was young at the time, more boy than lyrian. My parents had a house in the forest, a modest-sized piece of land but it was a nice spot. We were happy there. "#(GO TO 23.5.)
    #23.5.

    yandar "One evening I'd stayed out longer than intended – time had gotten away from me and it was beginning to get dark. "#(GO TO 23.7.)
    #23.7.
    yandar "So I decided to take a shortcut home, one which took me through someone else's property, a place just a couple of miles from my home. "#(GO TO 23.8.)
    #23.8.
    yandar "It was an old house with some gardens. As far as my parents and I knew, no one lived there on a permanent basis, but someone owned and maintained it. So while it seemed empty most of the time, it wasn't abandoned. "#(GO TO 23.9.)
    #23.9.
    yandar "In the handful of times I'd taken a shortcut through the property before that evening, I'd never seen a soul there. But this time was different. "#(GO TO 23.10.)
    #23.10.
    yandar "As I reached the edge of the trees near the house, I stopped when I saw some activity just outside the front entrance. Like I said, it was getting dark, so it was hard to make out some details, but I saw everything clearly enough. "#(GO TO 23.11.)
    #23.11.
    yandar "Outside the front of the house was a cart and some horses, and the lyrians who seemed to have just ridden them onto the property. There were six of them, all dressed in royal guard uniforms – lyrians belonging to High Lord Tialas. "#(GO TO 23.12.)
    #23.12.
    player_narration "Yandar paused and took a sip from the glass of apple juice which stood on the table before him. I remained silent, not wanting to interrupt his story. After a moment, he continued. "#(GO TO 23.13.)
    #23.13.
    yandar "I watched them from the shadows of the trees. I was curious. Two of the lyrians led all of the horses towards the stables, another two entered the house... "#(GO TO 23.14.)
    #23.14.
    yandar "...and the final two dragged someone out from beneath a tarp on the back of their cart. The person's wrists and ankles were tied, and they had a sack over their head. With the distance and poor lighting, I couldn't tell if it was a lyrian or a lyria. "#(GO TO 23.15.)
    #23.15.
    yandar "The two royal guards dragged their prisoner into the house. The two who'd gone to the stables followed after them and shut the door behind them. "#(GO TO 23.16.)
    #23.16.
    yandar "I waited and watched for another ten minutes or so but didn't see anything else. And I knew I had to leave, otherwise I'd be trying to find my way home in total darkness. I turned around and took the long way instead of the shortcut. "#(GO TO 23.17.)
    #23.17.
    yandar "All the way home I worried over what I'd seen, turning it over in my mind. I was young but I wasn't stupid – a group of armed men dragging someone into a house in the middle of the forest, I knew that wasn't right. "#(GO TO 23.18.)
    #23.18.
    yandar "When I reached home, my parents chastised me for being late for supper. I told them what I'd seen at the house. "#(GO TO 23.19.)
    #23.19.
    player_narration "I noticed the muscles in Yandar's jaw suddenly tighten as he looked off to one side of the room, his brow furrowing as he fought to control his emotions. "#(GO TO 23.20.)

    yandar "Gods, if I'd just kept my mouth shut... "#(GO TO 23.21.)
    #23.21.
    player_narration "Yandar trailed off but he didn't need to finish the sentence for me to see that he was wracked with guilt. I wanted to comfort him but knew I needed to hear the rest of his story first. "#(GO TO 23.22.)
    #23.22.
    player_narration "After a few seconds, he took a deep breath, regaining his composure before he continued. "#(GO TO 23.23.)
    #23.23.
    yandar "The next day, my parents sent me to stay with my uncle here in Lyr-Taer. Just for a few days, they said. "#(GO TO 23.24.)
    #23.24.
    yandar "They didn't tell me to my face but I knew why – I'd overheard them discussing it during the night. My father was going to investigate the house where I'd seen the guards and their prisoner... "#(GO TO 23.25.)
    #23.25.
    yandar "...and my mother thought it would be safer for me to be away from home while my parents were dealing with the situation. I barely knew Melas but my parents knew I was in safe hands with him. "#(GO TO 23.26.)
    #23.26.
    player "Wait, so Melas is your uncle? "#(GO TO 23.27.)
    #23.27.
    yandar "My father's younger brother. They weren't very close – they lived very different lives – but they seemed to be there for each other when it counted. "#(GO TO 23.28.)
    #23.28.
    yandar "I don't think Melas was thrilled about his young nephew hanging around and cramping his style, but we shared one thing, and that was concern for my parents. "#(GO TO 23.29.)
    #23.29.

    #23.30.
    yandar "A week passed and we heard nothing from my parents, so Melas' patience finally ran out and we travelled back home together to see what was going on. When we got there... "#(GO TO 23.31.)
    #23.31.
    player_narration "Once again Yandar paused, the pain of reliving terrible memories clear on his face. Part of me felt guilty but I knew there was no stopping it now. "#(GO TO 23.32.)
    #23.32.
    yandar "My parents' house had burned down. With them inside it. There was nothing left but charred ruins. We... we buried what remained of my mother and father. "#(GO TO 23.33.)
    #23.33.
    yandar "The fire had been fierce and thorough, it was impossible to learn anything from the scene about what exactly had happened. It could've been an accident. "#(GO TO 23.34.)
    #23.34.
    yandar "Except it wasn't. My parents had decided to find out what was going on at that house, and within days they were both dead. That was no coincidence. "#(GO TO 23.35.)
    #23.35.
    yandar "I was a mess, of course. Melas kept himself together, at least in front of me. That's the kind of lyrian he is. Although to his credit, I think he wanted to be strong for my sake as much as for his own. "#(GO TO 23.36.)
    #23.36.
    yandar "He knew what I did: that the fire had been no accident, and that going to the authorities wasn't an option. Not that he would have anyway. We knew it was up to us to settle things. "#(GO TO 23.37.)
    #23.37.
    yandar "Melas went to the house where I'd seen the royal guards but the place had been cleaned out. There was no trace of anyone having been there recently. "#(GO TO 23.38.)
    #23.38.
    yandar "So we returned to Lyr-Taer. Melas took me in, he knew I had nowhere else to go. All I cared about was finding and killing the lyrians who had taken my mother and father from me. "#(GO TO 23.39.)
    #23.39.
    yandar "Melas knew the city well, especially its underbelly. He carried out his own investigation, focusing on the house in the forest and the royal guards. "#(GO TO 23.40.)
    #23.40.
    yandar "But time after time, every potential lead led to nothing but a dead end. As good as Melas was, the truth was just too well-hidden. "#(GO TO 23.41.)
    #23.41.
    yandar "I was angry. Frustrated. I knew Melas was doing his best but I didn't care. He urged patience and the need to go about things the right way. I didn't want to hear it. "#(GO TO 23.42.)
    #23.42.
    yandar "But as the weeks turned into months, and the months turned into years, life went on, and even with my need for revenge, I just seemed to go along with it. "#(GO TO 23.43.)
    #23.43.
    yandar "I got a job, made some friends, moved out of Melas' house and into my own place. Don't get me wrong, the thought of avenging my parents was always with me, but as I said... life went on. "#(GO TO 23.44.)
    #23.44.
    yandar "Then, a couple of years ago, I woke up one morning and looked at the calendar, and it suddenly hit me just how much time had passed since the death of my parents. "#(GO TO 23.45.)
    #23.45.
    yandar "I couldn't believe it. It had flown by. And suddenly, all I could think was, "You've failed them."My mother and father were long in their graves while the people who'd put them there still roamed free, unpunished. "#(GO TO 23.46.)
    #23.46.
    yandar "I'd sworn an oath to avenge my parents, one I hadn't lived up to. That morning, I decided I'd keep my word... or die in the attempt. "#(GO TO 23.47.)
    #23.47.
    yandar "Also, something else hit me. Those lyrians I saw at the house that day, the royal guards – which among them had actually killed my parents? A couple of them? All of them? Was it even the same royal guards I'd seen? "#(GO TO 23.48.)
    #23.48.
    yandar "I realised that the responsibility lay not with those individual lyrians but with their master, the lyrian who commanded the royal guards and regular city guards alike: Tialas. "#(GO TO 23.49.)
    #23.49.
    player_narration "I frowned and shifted in my seat. For Yandar's sake, I wasn't sure I liked where this was going. "#(GO TO 23.50.)
    #23.50.
    yandar "What were those royal guards doing at that house, if not carrying out Tialas' orders? Why would they have murdered my parents? To protect their master and his secrets, that's why. "#(GO TO 23.51.)
    #23.51.
    yandar "Those lyrians may have done the deed but it was done in Tialas' name. He's the one with my parents' blood on his hands. So he became my target. "#(GO TO 23.52.)
    #23.52.
    yandar "When Tialas is dead... my parents can finally rest. I'll have finally avenged them. "#(GO TO 23.53.)
    #23.53.

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. There are a few customers scattered around the room, eating, drinking and talking. Player-Character (PC) is standing behind the counter, there is no sign of Yandar. Standing on the opposite side of the counter to PC is Lathien.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was evening at the Golden Meadow and I was nearing the end of a long shift, having been working since late morning."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The day had been a fairly eventful one, and frankly I'd been glad for the distraction from my preoccupying concern for Yandar."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Around lunchtime a pair of city guards had entered the inn and questioned myself, Yandar and a handful of customers about the recent burglaries and vandalism involving the bard contest finalists."
    #4. 
    player_narration "No one had any new information for them, and I was curious about the city guard's sudden renewed interest in the matter."
    #5. 
    player_narration "The guards eventually left, the rest of the day went on as normal and gradually my thoughts moved away from the bard contest and back to Yandar, who had spent much of the evening so far out on unspecified errands."
    #6. 
    player_narration "When Lathien entered through the front door and strode up to the counter, I was glad for yet another distraction. And Lathien could certainly be distracting when he wanted to be."
    #7. 
    player_narration "A wide grin was plastered across Lathien's face as he slammed a fistful of coins down on the counter and then looked at me. The coins added up to a sizeable amount. I nodded at the money and raised an eyebrow, curious."
    #8. 
    player "Either that's a very generous tip or you're planning on getting incredibly drunk tonight."
    #9.

    lathien "Exactly. Remember the criminal who broke my lute and tore up my clothes before the final round of the bard contest? They've finally caught the bastard!"
    #15. 
    player_narration "It seemed that the apparent renewed interest in the crime which had brought those guards to the Golden Meadow earlier in the day had paid off."
    #16. 
    player "So who was it?"
    #17. 
    player_narration "Lathien paused for dramatic effect, an extremely satisfied grin on his face. He was enjoying this."
    #18. 
    lathien "Bryn."
    #19. 
    player "As in the winner of the contest? Bryn the bard?"
    #20. 
    lathien "None other."
    #21. 
    lathien "I thought at the time that it might have been one of my rivals, although my suspicions had focused on Mahrys because she'd suffered the least damage to her possessions..."
    #22. 
    lathien "...but I suppose that had just been Bryn trying to throw everyone off the scent."
    #23. 
    player "But Bryn had to use a replacement instrument and clothing just like the rest of you – why would he sabotage himself?"
    #24. 
    lathien "Well, he couldn't not do himself, could he, that would be too obvious. Ultimately I think it was the desperate last resort of a scared lyrian who knew he couldn't win the contest legitimately."
    #25. 
    player "How did the city guard find out it was him?"
    #26. 
    lathien "From what I've been told, they received an anonymous tip leading them to some damning evidence hidden at Bryn's house. I'm not sure what the evidence was, but it was enough to make an arrest."
    #27. 
    player "Hm. If Bryn had gotten away with it until now, you'd think he'd have had the sense not to keep any evidence in his own house."
    #28. 
    lathien "Who knows how the criminal mind works? But it seems Bryn was no better a criminal than he was a bard. He'll have plenty of time to think on his failings while he's rotting in a prison cell."
    #29. 
    player "What does this mean in terms of the bard contest and Tialas' anniversary celebration?"
    #30. 
    player_narration "Lathien puffed up his chest and looked more self-satisfied than ever, if that was possible."
    #31. 
    lathien "It means you're looking at the true, legitimate winner of the contest, and the bard who's going to perform at the celebration."
    #32. 
    player "So they're stripping Bryn of his victory?"
    #33. 
    lathien "The victory he stole from me? Yes, they are. And gods bless the great justice system we have to thank for it, eh?"
    #34. 
    player "I suppose congratulations are in order. Good luck at the anniversary."
    #35. 
    lathien "Thank you, [PLAYER NAME], but a clever lyrian makes his own luck."
    #36. 
    lathien "Now, a mug of ale for me, please, and a round of drinks for all my friends here, including yourself. You can join me in a toast."
    #37. 
    player "Would this toast happen to be a toast to yourself?"
    #38. 
    lathien "As if I would be so immodest. Although, performing at Tialas' anniversary will guarantee me a place in the history books, won't it..."
    #39. 
    lathien "...so perhaps a few drinks in my honour would be fitting after all. "

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. The room is illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling – it is late at night, the inn having closed for the day. Yandar is sitting alone at a table, a mug of ale before him. Player-Character (PC) stands in the doorway, looking at Yandar.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The day marking Tialas' five-hundred-year anniversary as High Lord had arrived and was now coming to an end – it was late, the Golden Meadow having closed its doors nearly an hour ago."
    #2. 
    player_narration "The notable occasion had led to Lyr-Taer being busier and livelier than usual, even if the official event itself had been contained within the walls of the High Lord's mansion."
    #3. 
    player_narration "People took to the streets, the shops, the markets and the inns, some celebrating in genuine support of Tialas' rule while others simply used the occasion as an excuse for revelry."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I'd worked a long and busy shift at the inn, a steady stream of customers coming and going throughout the day. Some praised Tialas, some criticised him, and some didn't care to voice their opinion one way or another. "
    #5. 
    player_narration "As for me, I'd spent the day giving more thought to Yandar than Tialas."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Thanks to my bluff, he'd given me his word that he would call off his planned assassination of Tialas, set to happen this very evening."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Although he hadn't said anything to the contrary since, he'd been distracted a lot of the time, and on the occasions I tried to speak to him about the Tialas situation, he always changed or outright avoided the subject."
    #8. 
    player_narration "And so, despite Yandar's word, today had been a long and tense day, as part of me kept expecting someone to burst through the door and announce that High Lord Tialas had been murdered at his party."
    #9. 
    player_narration "But there had been no such announcement, and eventually the evening had come to an end. The Golden Meadow closed its doors, and Yandar and I cleaned up before ascending to our respective rooms."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Sleep had refused to come, however, and when I heard movement downstairs in the main room, I dressed again and went to investigate."
    #11. 
    player_narration "I found Yandar sitting alone at a table, one hand wrapped around a half-empty mug of ale. I watched him from the doorway for a moment. He seemed unaware of my presence, his body mostly turned away from me."
    #12. 
    player_narration "I stepped into the room. As I approached his table, Yandar turned his head to look up at me. He looked tired."
    #13. 
    player "Can't sleep?"
    #14. 
    yandar "No. You'd think I'd be able to, it's been a long enough day."
    #15. 
    player_narration "I sat down in the chair opposite Yandar, facing him. He nodded in the direction of the counter."
    #16. 
    yandar "Grab yourself a drink."
    #17. 
    player "No thanks. I wouldn't want to fall asleep in it and drown."
    #18. 
    yandar "You worked a busy shift today, you should go back to bed and get some sleep."
    #19. 
    player "I will in a little while, I'm fine at the moment."
    #20. 
    player_narration "A silence descended, Yandar taking infrequent sips at his drink while I glanced around the room. The only sounds were the typical sounds the large, old building made as it settled at night."
    #21. 
    yandar "So are you going to ask me?"
    #22. 
    player "Ask you what?"
    #23. 
    yandar "If I definitely called off my plan for Tialas."
    #24. 
    player "If you hadn't, I don't think I'd have missed the commotion that would've come afterwards. Besides, you gave me your word, and I don't think you'd break it."
    #25. 
    player_narration "Yandar looked at me with a thoughtful expression and then took a drink. He set the mug back down and gazed into it as he spoke."
    #26. 
    yandar "I've been tempted, I'm not going to lie. Today's been tough, thinking of that grand party going on not far away, all in his honour... but no, I haven't broken my word."
    #27. 
    yandar "And there have been times I've been angry at you for forcing me into this position, for denying me my revenge. But ultimately it was my choice, and I know you were just thinking of me, doing what you thought was right."
    #28. 
    player "I didn't like threatening you like that, if I thought there was – "
    #29. 
    player_narration "Yandar took one hand off his mug and raised it slightly, the palm facing me. I stopped talking as he looked up from his ale and at me, his expression troubled but determined."
    #30. 
    yandar "You don't need to explain. I understand."
    #31. 
    yandar "You told me I could still get the justice I want. That I didn't have to kill Tialas to get it, that there'd be another way. So, have you come up with any bright ideas since then?"
    #32. 
    player_narration "I hadn't, and Yandar knew it. Perhaps I should have done. I opened my mouth to speak but then closed it again, thinking that anything I might say would sound like an empty excuse."
    #33. 
    yandar "I didn't think so. Not exactly simple, coming up with a way to legally bring down the High Lord of our entire nation, is it. Funny, that."
    #34. 
    yandar "No offence, but if my uncle couldn't come up with something in all these years, well..."
    #35. 
    yandar "To be honest, I didn't expect you to pull a miracle out of thin air. And a small part of me wonders if you really were being sincere when you threatened to turn me in."
    #36. 
    yandar "But even so, and even with how long I've waited, how much I want this... I did give you my word, and I will keep it."
    #37. 
    yandar "Because... it makes a difference, just knowing that you're behind me. That I can rely on you. It helps. Makes me think that perhaps you're right."
    #38. 
    yandar "I just need to know that's not going to change."
    #39. 
    player "It won't. And on that you have my word."
    #40. 
    player_narration "Yandar nodded, a thoughtful frown on his face. He raised his mug and drained the remainder of his ale in several swallows."
    #41. 
    yandar "Go and get some sleep. I'll be going to bed myself in a minute."
    #42. 
    player_narration "I nodded, rising to my feet."
    #43. 
    player "See you in the morning?"
    #44. 
    player_narration "Yandar looked up at me with a fleeting smile."
    #45. 
    yandar "See you in the morning."
    #46. 
    player_narration "I went to bed, and slept soundly. "

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The inn is fairly busy, the room almost filled with customers. Player-Character (PC) and Yandar stand together behind the counter.
    #1. 
    player_narration "The day marking Tialas' five-hundred-year anniversary as High Lord had arrived, a notable occasion which had Lyr-Taer busier and livelier than usual, even if the official event itself was contained within the walls of the High Lord's mansion."

    #3. 
    player_narration "It was well into the evening now, but I'd started work at the Golden Meadow earlier in the day and had seen and served a steady stream of customers throughout my shift."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Some of these customers praised Tialas, some criticised him, and some didn't care to voice their opinion one way or another."
    #5. 
    player_narration "As for me, I'd spent the day giving more thought to Yandar than Tialas."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Ever since I told him about Dahenwar, and how I believed he'd been seeking revenge on the wrong lyrian all this time, Yandar had been like a lyrian adrift."
    #7. 
    player_narration "He'd been distracted more often than not, unable to concentrate on much, lacking enthusiasm and his usual good cheer. I didn't mind picking up the slack at work but still I hoped his mood would improve soon."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I'd tried to speak to him a couple of times but hadn't gotten much in return. As far as I could tell, though, he'd accepted what I'd told him and had called off his planned assassination of Tialas as a result."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Even so, today had been a long and tense day, the last few hours in particular dragging as part of me kept expecting someone to burst through the door and announce that High Lord Tialas had been murdered at his party."
    #10. 
    player_narration "But there was no such announcement, and I had to admit that Yandar actually seemed more upbeat and alert today than he had in some time."
    #11. 
    player_narration "I was thinking about this when, during a sudden lull at the counter, Yandar walked up to me as I was in the middle of cleaning some mugs. I turned to face him."
    #12. 
    yandar "Busy night. Are you managing?"
    #13. 
    player "We've had busier, I'm fine."
    #14. 
    player "...Are you alright?"
    #15. 
    player_narration "I wasn't referring to how Yandar was handling work, and we both knew it. He looked away for a moment, frowning, and then turned back to me. A smile appeared fleetingly on his lips."
    #16. 
    yandar "I'm alright. Or at least I think I'm going to be, in time."
    #17. 
    player "I'm glad to hear it."
    #18. 
    yandar "Listen, I'm sorry about how I've been acting recently, it's just that... what you told me, it was... well, it was a difficult thing to hear."
    #19. 
    yandar "At first I didn't want to believe it, didn't want to think that I'd wasted so much time and hatred on the wrong lyrian..."
    #20. 
    yandar "...but I spoke to Melas about it, and with what I told him in mind, he did some digging. Everything points to you being right. It was never Tialas. It was Dahenwar."
    #21. 
    player "And Dahenwar has already been punished for his crimes. Your mother and father can rest in peace."
    #22. 
    yandar "I suppose so. It's an odd feeling – half of me is angry that I couldn't take revenge personally, while the other half is just glad it's over."
    #23. 
    player "That's understandable."
    #24. 
    player_narration "I glanced towards the counter to check that no customers were close enough to overhear us, and then lowered my voice slightly."
    #25. 
    player "So... your plans for Tialas..."
    #26. 
    yandar "Called off. Don't worry about that. Sorry, I know I should've told you sooner, but with how distracted I've been..."
    #27. 
    player "It's alright. I'm just glad things have worked out."
    #28. 
    yandar "Thank you, [PLAYER NAME]. This whole thing has been hard but sometimes the truth hurts, right?"
    #29. 
    yandar "But the truth can be a gift as well, and that's what you've given me. Not to mention you've stopped me from making a terrible mistake. Perhaps even saved my life."
    #30. 
    player "Perhaps a wage increase is in order."
    #31. 
    yandar "Well, let's not get carried away..."

    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink.

The room is illuminated by the sunlight streaming in through the windows – it is early morning, the inn not yet open for business.

    #4. 
    player_narration "Instead he was standing behind the counter, resting on the surface of which was a large wicker basket, its lid open."
    #5. 
    player_narration "Around the basket was a wide variety of food and drink, and Yandar was carefully and neatly packing these items into the open basket."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I stood and watched for a moment, wondering what Yandar was up to, when he suddenly became aware of my presence. He looked up from the basket and smiled at me."

    yandar "Good morning."
    #8. 
    player "Morning."

    yandar "Actually, yes. And you're coming with me."

    yandar "We deserve a day off, and I was hoping you might fancy spending it together, with a picnic in the forest. I know a nice little spot where we can go."
    #13. 
    player "You might need a wheelbarrow rather than a basket for all that food and drink."
    #14. 
    yandar "Better too much than too little, eh? Anyway, if we're too stuffed afterwards, we can just roll each other home. So, what do you think?"
    #15. 
    player_narration "I had to admit to being surprised, but it was nice to see Yandar happy and enthusiastic, and the two of us going on a picnic together sounded good to me."

    player "I think it's a great idea. But what about this place? If neither of us is here..."
    #17. 
    yandar "I'm paying a friend to run the place while we're out. He used to work at an inn years ago, he knows the trade, and I've already told him the necessary details. After we leave here, I'll drop the keys off with him. It's fine, I trust him."
    #18. 
    player "Well, since you've gone to all this effort, how could I refuse? Do you need a hand with anything?"
    #19. 
    yandar "No, I've got it. I won't be long. I've made us a flask of coffee, pour yourself a cup if you want a little eye-opener before we go. "
    #20. 
    player "I'm alright, I'll wait until we're at this picnic spot."
    #21. 
    player_narration "Yandar nodded and continued filling the picnic basket while I took a seat on a nearby stool and waited for him. We chatted for a few minutes until the food and drink had all disappeared from sight and Yandar closed the lid of the basket."

    #Location: A clearing in the woods, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● Skip ahead several hours and it is now late morning, the sun shining in the sky. We are in a pleasant clearing somewhere within a wooded area, and this is where Yandar and PC are having their picnic. They sit on a large blanket spread out on the grass, a variety of food and drink laid out around them.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Yandar's picnic spot turned out to be over a mile outside the city walls, but with the day being as beautiful as it was, I didn't mind the walk. I offered to carry the picnic basket some of the way but Yandar refused."
    #2. 
    player_narration "We spoke a little as we strolled, although much of the time we were content to simply enjoy the cool breeze, the glorious sunshine, and the lilting birdsong."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Eventually we entered a patch of woodland, and soon after that, the clearing which was to be our picnic spot. It was a lovely place, peaceful but not too quiet, and bathed in sunlight."
    #4. 
    player_narration "Yandar spread out a large blanket he'd brought with him, and we sat down on it. Then he opened the basket and began to withdraw its contents."
    #5. 
    player_narration "This turned out to be a fairly lengthy task, as Yandar brought out a selection of prepared pastries, meats, vegetables, sandwiches, and other foods, not to mention a choice of drinks in the form of tea, coffee, ale and wine."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I was overwhelmed and told Yandar he needn't have gone to so much trouble, but he waved off my comment and told me to tuck in, which I gladly did."
    #7. 
    player_narration "We ate and drank until we were both full, again only speaking occasionally, and only then about trivial or amusing matters. It was enough for us to simply enjoy each other's company."
    #8. 
    player_narration "As the latest comfortable silence fell, Yandar lay back on the blanket and closed his eyes, a contented smile on his lips. I looked at him, prepared to quickly avert my gaze if he opened his eyes and caught me staring."
    #9. 
    player_narration "It occurred to me that not only was this one of the rare occasions I had seen Yandar outside of work, it was the most time I'd spent with him outside of the Golden Meadow in a single sitting. It was nice."
    #10. 
    player_narration "Although Yandar and I had known each other for a while now, our relationship had always revolved around the focal point of the Golden Meadow..."
    #11. 
    player_narration "...and while I'd certainly come to feel a fondness for the place, spending time with Yandar like this, away from the inn and the city and any of their associated troubles, was a real breath of fresh air."
    #12. 
    player_narration "And judging by the contented smile on Yandar's lips, he seemed to feel the same."
    #13. 
    player_narration "After a few more minutes of tranquillity, Yandar suddenly opened his eyes and sat up."
    #14. 
    yandar "Right, then. I hope you left room for dessert."
    #15. 
    player "Do I have a choice?"
    #16. 
    yandar "Not really."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Yandar reached both hands into the basket and withdrew from the seemingly bottomless container a covered silver dish which he set down between us. Then he removed the lid of the dish, revealing what lay beneath."
    #18. 
    player_narration "It was one of the most impressive and downright appetising-looking desserts I'd ever laid eyes on, a carefully constructed riot of textures, colours, patterns and ingredients."
    #19. 
    player_narration "Of course I knew that Yandar was a talented chef, particularly when it came to sweet foods, but even so, this must have taken him a great deal of time and effort. He raised his eyes from the dessert and looked at me expectantly."
    #20. 
    yandar "Well?"
    #21. 
    player "You've outdone yourself. This looks incredible."
    #22.

    #Location: Golden Meadow Inn, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Night)
    #● We are inside the Golden Meadow Inn in Lyr-Taer, specifically the main room where customers come to eat and drink. It is night, the room illuminated by the candle chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The inn is busy, with customers sitting at tables and at the counter, drinking, eating and talking. Player-Character (PC) and Yandar are working behind the counter.
    #1. 
    player_narration "It was a busy evening at the Golden Meadow, with business moving at a brisk pace but not so much that Yandar and I were rushed off our feet."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Yandar had been in fine spirits throughout the entirety of my shift so far, which had begun that afternoon. When he wasn't bantering with me or the customers, he was whistling or humming to himself, his smile rarely leaving his face."
    #3. 
    player_narration "In fact, this wasn't a brand-new occurrence, as he'd been in a similar mood during my past several shifts at the inn."
    #4. 
    player_narration "He seemed happy and carefree, acting like a lyrian who'd had a great weight lifted off his shoulders, and his happiness lifted my own spirits in turn."
    #5. 
    player_narration "The dark moods which Yandar had occasionally exhibited since I'd started working at the Golden Meadow seemed a thing of the past now, and I was glad for it."
    #6. 
    player_narration "We were currently working at opposite ends of the counter, Yandar taking a food order from one customer while I poured a drink for another."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I looked over at Yandar just in time to see him reach one hand beneath the counter and into an open bag of chocolates he kept there. He withdrew one and popped it into his mouth while nodding at his customer's order."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I couldn't help but smile. Although Yandar had never really lost his sweet tooth, the lightening of his mood had caused it to return with gusto, and nowadays he frequently had a bag of chocolates or sweets close to hand while working."
    #9. 
    player_narration "As I finished serving my customer and took his money, Yandar looked over at me, smiling even as one cheek bulged slightly with the chocolate he had in his mouth."

    player_narration "After I picked up the requested sandwiches, I turned to look at Yandar and at the crowd of faces around the room, some unknown but most belonging to regular customers."

    player_narration "The atmosphere was lively and joyful, and I wondered how much of that could be attributed to Yandar's infectious cheerfulness."

    dahenwar "So I'm inviting you to attend private lessons here at the guild. These lessons would be more involved than the standard classes you've been taking, the sorcery more advanced."

    #● We are in a grassy spot at the edge of some woodland, just south of Lyr-Taer. The area is quiet and secluded, with no buildings or other signs of civilisation in sight. Player-Character (PC) and an unnamed, cloaked lyrian are the only people present.

    #4.

    #11. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn was complaining about the sorcery lessons and Dahenwar's teaching – or rather, the lack of it – and the other lyria agreed, although she didn't seem to feel as strongly about it as Myrileyn."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Then there was talk about the city library, Myrileyn apparently having some kind of idea regarding the place. While I didn't overhear the specifics of her plan, the other lyria agreed to it, whatever it was."

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Myrileyn and Alynore, a fellow student from the Mages' Guild, are sitting together at a table in a quiet, private corner of the library, away from the other people scattered around it. Player-Character (PC) stands nearby, hidden behind a set of bookshelves.
    #1. 
    player_narration "I stood in the city library with my heart thumping in my chest and a sick feeling in my stomach. This is wrong, a voice in my mind kept telling me, although I'd been doing my best to ignore it."
    #2. 
    player_narration "In the general stillness of the library – and particularly in the quiet and private ground-floor corner where I stood – my heartbeat sounded loud in my ears, as did my breathing."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I was standing before one of the many tall bookshelves which filled the library, although I paid no attention to any of the numerous books spread out in rows before me."
    #4. 
    player_narration "I hadn't come here today to read. I was here on a mission."
    #5. 
    player_narration "I listened to the two voices coming from the opposite side of the bookshelf: Lady Myrileyn and another student from the Mages' Guild, the lyria she'd spoken to about a plan involving this library – information I'd passed on to Dahenwar."
    #6. 
    player_narration "Myrileyn and Alynore – Dahenwar had told me the lyria's name – kept their voices low as they spoke, the two of them sitting together at a table with some books and notes spread out before them."
    #7. 
    player_narration "Although I couldn't see them from where I stood due to the bookshelf that separated us, I'd watched them for a time beforehand, being sure to keep my distance so as not to be spotted and recognised."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I'd followed them here on Dahenwar's orders, the Archmage having told me that Mages' Guild students practicing sorcery at the city library was strictly forbidden, and as such it had to be stopped."
    #9. 
    player_narration "He claimed that catching Myrileyn and Alynore red-handed wouldn't be enough, however, due to Myrileyn being the High Lord's daughter – she'd get away with a slap on the wrist, which wouldn't dissuade her for long."
    #10. 
    player_narration "So Dahenwar had another plan, one which would see the two lyria suitably punished for their transgression. A plan in which I would be instrumental."
    #11. 
    player_narration "He was going to teach me a new spell, one which I'd memorise and then stealthily cast near Myrileyn and Alynore after having followed them into the city library."
    #12. 
    player_narration "Dahenwar refused to tell me what exactly the spell would do, which naturally only increased my suspicion of his plan..."
    #13. 
    player_narration "...but he made it very clear that I was once again presented with the same choice he'd given me before: do as he said or lose my private tuition. As wary as I was of his plan, it was no choice at all."
    #14. 
    player_narration "And so Dahenwar taught me the spell he wanted me to cast, while still refusing to reveal its effect."
    #15. 
    player_narration "I tried to carry out my own research on it but found nothing – it was an obscure and convoluted spell which had also been personalised to a degree by Dahenwar, further obscuring its origins."
    #16. 
    player_narration "Earlier today I'd arrived at my latest sorcery class at the Mages' Guild to find myself sharing the room with Myrileyn and Alynore."
    #17. 
    player_narration "Dahenwar must have arranged it so that the three of us would be present, and the look the Archmage gave me made it clear that he expected me to carry out my part of the plan should the two lyria head to the city library after class."
    #18. 
    player_narration "As it turned out, that was exactly what they did, and I followed at a discreet distance. And so that was how I came to be where I was now, preparing to cast a spell about which I knew dangerously little."
    #19. 
    player_narration "But I'd delayed long enough. It was too late to back out now. I glanced around and although I could hear scattered noises around the library – footsteps, pages being turned, the occasional cough – there was no one in sight."
    #20. 
    player_narration "Blocking out the hushed voices of Myrileyn and Alynore, I closed my eyes and focused on the spell which Dahenwar had taught me, forming it in my mind as I moved my hands before me in the correct sequence of gestures."
    #21. 
    player_narration "After a few seconds of intense concentration, the spell had been cast, and I opened my eyes and exhaled slowly and quietly. Then I thought about what Dahenwar had said I should do next: leave the library immediately."
    #22. 
    player_narration "Dahenwar had informed me beforehand that there would be no signs to suggest that any kind of sorcery was in use, the spell not intended to take immediate effect."
    #23. 
    player_narration "He'd been right – as I walked towards the main entrance, appearing more calm and inconspicuous than I actually felt, the library's omnipresent hush remained undisturbed."
    #24.

    PART A

    #Location: City library, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in the main room of Lyr-Taer's city library, the room being vast, with a very high ceiling and a second-floor balcony which runs around the whole room. Both the ground floor and second floor hold rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled with thousands of books. The room is illuminated by the daylight which enters through the numerous tall windows. Player-Character (PC) is standing at the main counter, talking to Belawen the librarian.
    #1. 
    player_narration "Some time had passed since I'd entered the city library on my mission from Dahenwar and cast the spell he'd taught me, the exact nature of which remained a mystery to me."
    #2. 
    player_narration "In the days and weeks afterwards I'd worried about it, wondering what it was that I'd been a part of. Dahenwar had shed no further light on things, and I'd heard nothing about Myrileyn or Alynore."
    #3. 
    player_narration "But as time passed I thought about it less and less, and eventually stopped worrying about it altogether."
    #4. 
    player_narration "So I felt no anxiety now as I once again entered the library, not on any suspicious mission this time but simply to return some books. I walked up to the counter, smiled at Belawen the librarian and was about to speak..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...when I saw something that caused the smile to fall from my face and all of the old anxiety to suddenly return."
    #6. 
    player_narration "A small section of the ground floor of the main room was cordoned off by rope barriers – it was the quiet, tucked-away corner where Myrileyn and Alynore had been sitting when I'd cast Dahenwar's spell."
    #7. 
    player_narration "The furniture and bookshelves which had stood within the cordoned-off area had all been removed, but there was a large, black stain covering much of the floor there..."
    #8. 
    player_narration "...and this was enough to make it clear that something had happened in that spot. Something bad. It looked like the floor had been scorched by intense fire."
    #9. 
    player_narration "I stared at the empty, blackened area, unable to think or speak for a moment, a horrible sinking feeling in my stomach. Then something suddenly got my attention – in a daze, I blinked and looked at Belawen."
    #10. 
    player_narration "The librarian was looking at me with a curious and expectant expression, apparently waiting for me to speak."
    #11. 
    player "I'm sorry, did you say something?"
    #12. 
    belawen "I asked if you were alright. You sort of... drifted off for a moment."
    #13. 
    player_narration "Despite the tension I felt, I forced myself to smile and act as normal as possible. I pointed in the direction of the seemingly fire-damaged area."
    #14. 
    player "Oh, I'm fine, I just noticed the closed-off area over there. What happened?"
    #15. 
    player_narration "Belawen turned her head to look at where I was pointing, and a sad expression appeared on her face. This did nothing to ease my mounting dread."
    #16. 
    belawen "I'm afraid there was a terrible accident in the library."
    #17. 
    belawen "High Lord Tialas' daughter, Lady Myrileyn, was sitting there one day with a friend, and the two of them were secretly practicing magic."
    #18. 
    belawen "I'm not sure of the exact details but something went wrong and there was an explosion. Lady Myrileyn suffered some injuries but was otherwise unhurt, but her friend... well, she died there and then. Poor lyria. Such a tragedy."
    #19. 
    belawen "So now Lady Myrileyn is going to be put on trial so that the truth about the whole awful business can come out. And as you can see, we haven't quite managed to repair all of the damage just yet."
    #20. 
    belawen "I suppose we should be grateful the whole library didn't catch fire. I shudder to think..."
    #21. 
    player_narration "I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. Belawen turned back to look at me but I couldn't speak. With a sad smile on her lips, she glanced at the books I was holding."
    #22. 
    belawen "Anyway, life goes on, I suppose. Are you returning those?"
    #23. 
    player_narration "My limbs felt numb but I nodded and managed to place the small stack of books down on the counter before me."
    #24. 
    player_narration "Belawen began checking them in as I mumbled my thanks, already turning away and walking back towards the main entrance."
    #25. 
    player_narration "With every step I half-expected someone to point at me and shout, "That's [him! / her!] [He's / She's] the one who killed that lyria!"But no one I passed spoke or even gave me a second glance."
    #26. 
    player_narration "Still, I couldn't lie to myself that the "accident"which had injured Myrileyn and killed Alynore was nothing to do with me. It wasn't a coincidence. I knew better than that."
    #27. 
    player_narration "Whether he'd had murder in mind or not, Archmage Dahenwar had used me as a weapon, and now I had the blood of an innocent lyria on my hands. (GO TO PART B)"

    #1. 
    player_narration "Several hours after my visit to the Lyr-Taer library, I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at the letter I held in my hands."
    #2. 
    player_narration "It had been waiting for me when I'd returned home earlier, still shaken by the terrible truth I'd learned at the library. When I opened it, I found that it was from Archmage Dahenwar."
    #3. 
    player_narration "Dahenwar wrote that he wanted me to visit him at his private office at the Mages' Guild as soon as possible so I could receive my "reward.""
    #4. 
    player_narration "The only thing I could think of for which he'd want to reward me was what I did at the library. One innocent lyria was dead and another was wrongly being put on trial for it..."
    #5. 
    player_narration "...and Dahenwar wanted to reward me. The thought made me feel ill."
    #6. 
    player_narration "So I sat down on my bed, feeling tired and burdened, and stared at the letter for a while, as if I could somehow will it into something better, something which didn't worsen the guilt I already felt."
    #7. 
    player_narration "As far as I knew, no one but Dahenwar was aware of my involvement in what had happened at the library. So if he and I both kept this information to ourselves then the blame would indeed likely end up sticking to Myrileyn."
    #8. 
    player_narration "I could get on with my life and not have to pay for what I'd done. The truth would remain buried. I told myself that Myrileyn wouldn't even receive much of a punishment anyway, although I didn't know if I believed that."
    #9. 
    player_narration "Or I could confess, inform the authorities of everything. That way, Myrileyn's name would be cleared... but I'd have to face punishment for my crime. And that was if Dahenwar didn't have me killed first."

    #Location: Mages' Guild, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are in Archmage Dahenwar's private office at the Mages' Guild. It is sometime during the day, and several large windows let in daylight. The room contains a desk, a couple of chairs and several sets of bookshelves. Dahenwar is sitting behind his desk as Player-Character (PC) enters the room.

    dahenwar "I summoned you here because your diligence in your studies and your ability to complete the tasks I've set you haven't gone unnoticed by me."
    #9.

    dahenwar "Assistant to the Archmage himself – you understand what a valuable opportunity this is, of course."

    PART D

    #Location: High Council Chambers, Lyr-Taer, Lyriathis (Day)
    #● We are inside the main room of Lyr-Taer's High Council Chambers. The room is large and grand, with tall windows letting in daylight from outside. Sitting in one of the High Council seats is High Lord Tialas, and sitting in the seat next to him is Archmage Dahenwar. Standing just inside the room with the main doors behind him is Player-Character (PC), and next to him is Sergeant Illinea, the two of them facing Tialas and Dahenwar. These four are the only people in the room.
    #1. 
    player_narration "When I entered the High Council Chambers and saw Archmage Dahenwar sitting at High Lord Tialas' side, I instantly knew I'd made a terrible mistake."
    #2. 
    player_narration "Earlier that morning, with a heavy heart but confident I was doing the right thing, I'd approached Sergeant Illinea of the city guard and told her that I wanted to confess to a crime."
    #3. 
    player_narration "I told her everything about Archmage Dahenwar's instructions and how I'd carried them out, and how this had led to Alynore's death and Myrileyn's injuries."
    #4. 
    player_narration "A little later, after Illinea had left for a time, I found myself being escorted to the High Council Chambers, the sergeant explaining that my story had been passed on to the High Lord, who decided that he wanted to speak to me personally."
    #5. 
    player_narration "We entered the building and Illinea led me into the main room. It was then that I saw Tialas and Dahenwar sitting side-by-side in their council seats, and cursed myself for a fool."
    #6. 
    player_narration "I was trying to reveal the truth, and of course Dahenwar would do everything in his power to prevent that. And so he'd gotten to Tialas before me in an effort to protect himself."
    #7. 
    player_narration "I'd do my best to convince the High Lord, but my hopes weren't high."
    #8. 
    player_narration "Illinea closed the doors behind us and then stood off to one side of me as I faced Tialas and Dahenwar, the two lyrians looking down at me with dark expressions."
    #9. 
    player_narration "For a few seconds there was nothing but tense silence, then finally the High Lord spoke, his voice stern."
    #10. 
    tialas "Sergeant Illinea tells me you claim to be the one responsible for harming my daughter. And that you did this on the orders of Archmage Dahenwar."
    #11. 
    player "...That's correct, sir. The Archmage taught me a spell, one he wanted me to cast near Lady Myrileyn and Alynore inside the library."
    #12. 
    player "I didn't know what effect the spell would have. I should've demanded to know what exactly the Archmage was involving me in... but I didn't. That was my mistake, and now I'm willing to pay for it."
    #13. 
    player "But I won't accept the whole blame – Archmage Dahenwar knew exactly what spell he was teaching me and what it would do."
    #14. 
    player_narration "Again silence fell as the two lyrians stared at me, Tialas with a thoughtful frown on his face while Dahenwar's expression was ice-cold. Without taking his eyes off me, Tialas nodded briefly."
    #15. 
    tialas "Exactly as you said, Dahenwar."
    #16. 
    dahenwar "Indeed."
    #17. 
    dahenwar "[PLAYER NAME], I suggest you stop before you embarrass yourself further and waste any more of our time."
    #18. 
    dahenwar "I've already informed the High Lord of your real reason for visiting the city guard this morning and filling Sergeant Illinea's head with these absurd lies of yours. They end now."
    #19. 
    player "You're the liar here – lying to protect yourself."
    #20. 
    dahenwar "What I'm protecting is my High Lord, a concerned father who doesn't need to be subjected to nonsensical tales while his family endures a difficult time."
    #21. 
    dahenwar "Even so, I did suggest he hear these things from your own lips, just to put his mind at rest and allow him to see for himself that you're nothing but a bitter little time-waster and failed sorcerer."
    #22. 
    player_narration "I felt my anger rising at the nerve of Dahenwar but made an effort to hold it in check. I knew that losing my temper, as satisfying as it would feel, would only make things worse."
    #23. 
    dahenwar "I've told High Lord Tialas how you were struggling with your sorcery lessons, how this made you more frustrated and bitter as time passed, and how it eventually led to you blaming your own shortcomings on me."
    #24. 
    dahenwar "The last time I saw you at the Mages' Guild, you threatened to "make me pay.""
    #25. 
    dahenwar "And this is how you've decided to do that, apparently: by slandering my name and involving me in this twisted scheme. Is your own life worth so little to you that you'd give a false confession simply in an attempt to drag me down with you?"
    #26. 
    player "Everything I've said is true and you know it."
    #27. 
    tialas "Enough."
    #28. 
    player_narration "Silence followed Tialas' voice for a moment as the High Lord stared at me with a hard frown. When he spoke, the tone of his voice was harder still."
    #29. 
    tialas "I've listened to you long enough. This comes down to your word against that of Archmage Dahenwar, and I have every reason to believe him and not a single one to believe you."
    #30. 
    tialas "Hurting my daughter is an extremely unwise thing to do – claiming you've done so when you haven't isn't quite as foolish, but it's close. Just consider yourself lucky that the latter is true in your case."
    #31. 
    tialas "You should also be grateful for the Archmage's forgiveness. While you've wasted my time here today, the false accusations you've made regarding him are far more serious, and more than worthy of some sort of official punishment."
    #32. 
    tialas "However, Dahenwar has informed me that he doesn't wish to pursue such punishment, and assures me that you will learn from this experience."
