This is the super duper basic outline. And by super basic, I mean literally the very basic thing.
All the storylines should generally involve this with tiny tweaks because of character stuff. But 
literally, this is the bones. Like, the spinal cord or something. Someone teach me anatomy later.

Aiyora is half demon/half angel, 
and was exiled at a young age with Maika and Serbon from their home. ? 
Aiyora met a witch who cursed her (See: Basic Plot Idea) ? 
Traveling with Serbon and Maika to find a cure for curse ? 
Meet Ison, who was ordered to kill Aiyora without knowing how the curse actually works ? 
Ison finds out he was lied to about the true curse ? 
Entire group searches for cure for Aiyora ? 
Some point end up back at Aiyora’s home town and disguise themselves ? 
Crash into Ison’s boss (Aiyora’s Uncle) whom just found out about the failed cursing of Aiyora from the witch who he apparently works with ?
 Uncle says the cure to the curse is killing witch, but no one believes him ? 
 Witch is provoked into making a potion for a sick girl who is dying of a curse, and gives it to Aiyora without realizing it ? 
 Aiyora gets sicker, is sent to jail with her father while sick. ? 
 Maika, Serbon and Ison work together to break out Aiyora and her father from jail. ? 
 Witch heals Aiyora by telling her it’s all about her emotions, and depending on who loves Aiyora the most at this point, they have to share a fruit with her and save her.

NOTE: It’s not as basic as I thought it’d be. Sorry.

Also...If at any point all fruits before end are eaten: Aiyora dies and game ends early.
