    alex ". . .Amicus Curiae is a Latin phrase which is literally translated as \"friend of the court\", is defined as someone who is not a party in the case, but volunteers information because he or she has an interest in the outcome.  This may come in the form of a brief, a legal opinion, or. . . *sigh*"

    "I look up from the indifferent glow of the holo at the emptiness of the library.  Rows and rows of angled bookshelves jut out of the walls, yet no one is there to browse them.  Of course not, no one cared to look at \"books\" anymore.  It was surprising they still maintained a whole floor for what everyone considered to be outdated technology.  Everyone was busy making plans for the upcoming weekend, socializing, and here I was-studying, as usual.  Still, there was something nice about having the whole floor to myself.  It was like it was all mine, and no one else's.  Well, except for the librarians who occasionally scuttled in to make sure I was behaving myself. "

    "Loud pounding footsteps come from the steps behind me, the ones that led down to the first floor.  I avert my eyes and try to return to the screen."

    alex "An Amicus Curiae must be approved by-"

    alyssa "I KNEW I'd find you here.  You spend way too much time in here.  I'm starting to think you prefer these dusty old books over your own girlfriend."

    "She makes a pouting face at me that I just can't resist.  I pull her towards me and give her a light kiss.  Had it been almost a year already?"

    alex "You know that isn't true.  How could I choose anything over you?  It's just that we have an exam coming up next week, and Professor Durham's are always difficult."

    alyssa "What's the point in making you memorize all this boring stuff anyway, when you can get all info you want from your comm in a blink of an eye.  He's such an outdated old geezer.  The university should just fire him and replace him with someone younger who gets how to use technology...and is cuuute!"

    "She flashes a huge grin at the thought.  I felt I should be a bit jealous that she was always fawning over the thought of some other guy, but what could I do?  I guess as long as it was all just the girlish fantasy in her mind, there was no harm in it."

    alex "Well unless management has a sudden change of heart, I still have a test to study for."

    "She puts her hands on her hips and tips her head to the side, pursing her lips in annoyance."

    alyssa "But I wanted you to go to that new dance club with me tonight! They've got all these holos there that make it so you can't even tell what's real and what's virtual.  I've been wanting to go so bad.  You promised you would go with me anytime I wanted!"

    "I didn't remember promising THAT exactly."

    alex "You know that I'd love to go with you, but this is really important, okay?  We'll go as soon as I get this test out of the way, I mean it.  The club isn't going anywhere."

    alyssa " You always say that, and you're always too busy."

    "Geez, I'd really done it this time.  I had to think quick or she'd be sulking for the rest of the week."

    alex "We'll go next Friday, right after my test."

    alyssa "Awwww, but there's a tournament then!  And they're only once a month!"

    alex "So?  Haven't you seen plenty of those?  There'll always be more."

    alyssa "But I never miss one.  I mean, virtual reality is like the coolest thing EVER!  It's so much cooler than the real world.  You can do magic and all kinds of stuff, and wear all these cool clothes without having to pay.  It's awesome!  Besides, lots of people go together-you know, like a DATE?  That thing that normal couples do."

    "It wasn't easy to miss the jab there. "

    alyssa "And it's totally in style right now.  Everyone goes."

    "\"In style\"?  I guess it was.  I could hardly remember the time when anything with the word \"virtual\" in it was just for geeks and nerds.  Now it's one big party scene, which is a perfect place for a girl like her, and just the sort of place that I prefer to keep my distance from.  It was a wonder that we were still together when we were such complete opposites.  She was the partier, and I was the stay-at-home studier.  It wasn't \"true love\" or anything like that.  I think we both just enjoyed the reliable companionship more than anything, so it worked out for both of us."

    "I really wanted to be the \"good\" boyfriend and do what she wanted here, but I just didn't get the hype What's the point if it's all fake anyway?  But if it would make her happy. . ."

    alyssa "--plus, I've got to be there to represent our fan club."

    alex "Fan club?"

    alyssa "My friends and I made it.  Don't you remember?  We've talked about it before."

    "Oh right.  THOSE girls.  The ones that were even more voracious fan-girls than she was.  Always giggling and squealing, and carrying on about something.  I think I must have blocked them from my memory on purpose."

    alex "What's it for?"

    alyssa "God, don't you ever listen to me, Alex?  Silver Phoenix?"
    "My blank expression wasn't quite what she wanted to see."

    alyssa "The mage that's been tearing up the charts, winning all the tournaments.  He's AWESOME, and soooo cute.  And he totally noticed our fan club last time.  Maybe this time we can get a private meeting with him after the tournament."

    "She gave her own best fan-girl squeal and wriggled with excitement, and then remembered that she was upset with me."

    alyssa "So I guess I'll have to miss out on our little date after all. But I guess I can always find some really fun guy there that'll hang out with me so I won't be lonely. . ."

    "It was impossible to miss that not-so-subtle air of resentment in her voice."

    alex "All right already.  If that's what you really want, I'll go with you."

    alyssa "Wow, you're finally going to make an account?  Geez, I can't believe it took me so long to convince you.  You're like the only one I know that doesn't have one yet."

    "At first I thought I had finally appeased her, but then a look of deadly seriousness crossed her face."

    alyssa "But you better be able to figure it out.  I don't want to look stupid just because I'm with you."

    "And then it was gone, replaced with her usual carefree grin as she sauntered off."

    alyssa "Omigosh, I can't wait!"

    alex "...Looking forward to it."

    "I put on my best fake grin, knowing that was the furthest thing from the truth. Ten years ago they came out with the technology to let people explore virtual worlds through their minds, and it was an instant hit.  Nowadays, everyone uses it, practically every chance they get.  Everything about it seems silly to me; the equipment-which is shaped like a diving suit and helmet- looks utterly ridiculous.  And for what?  Some game.  Don't people feel a sense of responsibility anymore?  Sure, we didn't need to work as much as previous generations, and everything was much easier to get nowadays, but still. . .why play around all day?  Why not do something more productive?"

    #TODO [scene change]"

    alex "So it just goes on like this...I guess?"

    "I fiddle with the helmet, trying to get it on just right.  The whole suit was a birthday gift from an aunt who doesn't know me very well.  She had felt bad for me because I was the only kid she knew without one.  Nobody ever told her that it was the last thing I could ever want.  . . .It seemed to be finally coming in handy.  I guess I could finally send her that \"thank you\" note in good conscience."

    alex "Better figure it out quick, or I'll be late.  I probably should have gotten started a bit earlier."

    "An absurdly cheery screen pops up, not in front of me, but within my mind.  It lauds the wonders of Virtuality in bright, bold font.   \"First time user?\" A second pop-up to my right asks, reading my comm information to find that I had no account.  The text changes:  \"Create an account!  It's easy!\" and a new page is brought up before me with the usual name, username, and password boxes.   My name is already entered for me, another bit of information it took from the comm. "

    #TODO [opportunity for player to create a username and password]"

    "Once I'm finished, the \"screen\" blips excitedly and flashes \"ACCOUNT CREATION ACCEPTED! \""

    alex "Whoa, that was it?  Man, they don't really waste time."

    "PLAY THE TUTORIAL?"

    alex "I don't think I have time. And I don't want to be late for meeting Alyssa .  Anyway, I think I can figure it out on my own. . . "

    "An empty room emerges from the darkness, nothing but plain white walls and floor.  The space seems endless somehow, despite the fact that I can clearly see all four walls.  There is no door."

    alex "So. . .what now?"

    "Before me materializes a female avatar.  She smiles at me pleasantly and begins motioning around the room with wide, sweeping gestures:"

    avatar "Welcome to the incredible world of Virtuality!  I am your personal avatar, here to guide you and teach you the basics of Virtuality.  Why don't you take a moment to give me a name?"  
    #[Opportunity for name choice]

    #Avatar[replaced by player name choice]:  
    avatar "Great!  I like it.  Now let's begin with the basics of Virtuality. Here you'll find that movement is as natural as it is in the real world.  In Virtuality there is no disconnect between you and your character, because here you are the character.  Go ahead and try walking around a bit."

    "I take a few hesitant steps forward, amazed that I felt no resistance, no distance between myself and my virtual self.  It really was easy.  Just like in real life, I didn't so much have to think about it, as I had to will myself to do it.  I felt like moving forward, and that is exactly what I am able to do.  After a time the avatar nods in approval and signals for me to stop."

    avatar "Now, let's move on."

    "You may be surprised to learn that you already hold the key to mastering Virtuality and claiming your place among its champion fighters and well-known figures-because that \"key\"is your imagination!  In Virtuality, simply think and you will achieve.  You are your only limit!  Give it a try.  Why not imagine some new clothes to replace the Virtuality suit?  I'm sure you can think of something you'd much rather wear."

    alex "Just imagine, huh?  I guess I can do that. . ."

    "I imagine some new clothes for myself, something that I hope will impress Alyssa.  I try to think of the style that she's always going on about other guys wearing; the one that she finds \"just so cute\". "

    "The gaudy diver's suit disappears and is replaced by my new clothing of choice.  I'm taken aback by how quickly the change takes place and just how easy it is.  It really only took a simple thought.  Everything I saw in my head was now represented perfectly on my body.  This really was incredible! For the most creative minds, this must be sheer heaven."

    avatar "Great job!  You look stylish in those new clothes!"

    "\"Stylish\"?  Perhaps the AI could still use some work. . ."

    avatar "Please keep in mind that you are only able to affect things relating to yourself with your imagination, as other individuals will have priority over themselves.  Since I am your own personal assistant avatar, you can change my appearance as well.  Why not give it a try, and select a new outfit for me?  Virtuality provides you with many options."

    alex "Yes, let's continue."

    "Oh, man-I'm gonna be late if I don't hurry this up."

    avatar "Now let's try creating and manipulating objects in Virtuality space.  Let's start with something simple.  Plain white walls are boring, aren't they?  Why don't you pick a new color."

    alex "Changing the wall colors is something \"simple\"?  Well I guess if I had to pick a color, I'd pick red, since it's my favorite."

    "Yeah, I guess red would be cool.  The white is immediately overtaken by just my favorite shade of red.  The room is looking a lot more vibrant now and not quite so sterile."

    avatar "That's better!  You can do more than just manipulate objects that are already there, however.  You can create new ones, too.  Why don't you imagine something to fill a bit of this empty space?"

    alex " Just create something out of thin air?  Well I guess I'll try the sofa in my room.   It has this neat red and black checkered pattern on it.  It'll match the walls, too."

    "Why was I babbling on like this to a computer program?  I concentrate on the image of the sofa in my mind, just as the avatar prompted."

    "And just like that, it was there, right where I imagined it.  I could feel the excitement, the child-like wonder in my chest.  I reach out and touch it; it's exactly as I was expecting– it feels so real.  How?  How was this all possible?"

    avatar "In an empty space like this, it is quite easy to create and manipulate objects.  As the only one here, your imagination easily takes priority.  This is also the case in areas which belong to you, that others may visit.  However, in shared common spaces only minor changes may be made to keep these areas neat and pleasant for everyone.  You may find it difficult at first to exercise your imagination in these areas, but with a little practice, you'll get the hang of it in no time!"

    "This concludes the introductory tutorial.  For more advanced tutorials, see \"help and guidance\".  Feel free to explore and experiment in this room as long as you would like.  When you're ready to join the rest of the world of Virtuality, simply let your imagination guide you!"

    "And once you get acclimated, be sure to check out all the different activities Virtuality has to offer.  You'll be able to participate in relaxing, simple tasks like decorating and managing your own virtual home and garden, as well as a number of super-charged sports.  Once you've honed your skills, you may even take part in our monthly tournaments.  There are many training options throughout Virtuality for low level players to get started-be sure to check them out."

    "And most of all, remember to have fun and enjoy your Virtuality experience!"

    "She fades away as she speaks these words, and I finally break out of my stupor.  I summon a clock to confirm my fears.  I was going to be late!"

    "I try to remember the name of the virtual city where Alyssa told me she would be.  I worry for a moment that I might have forgotten it, but then it leaps back into my mind.  Vega."

    "I need to go to the Vega Tournament Hall."

    "A pleasant tone sounds in my mind and the tutorial room fades from view, and a whole new setting rises up out of the blank space."

    "I'm placed in the middle of the virtual world without any warning.  The surrounding area is littered with modern architecture; colossal buildings which challenge the sky.  The area closely resembles our own city and feels almost like it could be a real place.  Some of the buildings are shops, others restaurants, various entertainment venues, and many other things I can't discern from just a glance.  There is a big crowd up ahead, mushroomed around a set of gates leading into a huge, domed coliseum type building.  Above it, there is a marquee floating in the air with scrolling text that could probably be seen for miles:  TOURNAMENT HALL – TODAY'S TOURNAMENT:  SILVER PHOENIX! DOORS CLOSING IN 10 MINUTES."

    "And just like that, there I was, caught in a crowd of people bunching around the ticket gates.  I look around in a daze trying to figure out where Alyssa might be waiting, and then suddenly feel a vindictive hand wrap around my arm, yanking me back."

    alyssa "Geez, could you be any later?  You're lucky I got the tickets already, or we'd be SOL."

    alex "Sorry, I had a hard time s-"

    alyssa "Whatever, you're here now, so let's go already."

    "Alyssa grabs my arm and leads us like a guided missile through the crowd.  She looks me up and down while dragging me forward.  I seem to have passed the test, as her contemplative frown is replaced with an approving grin."

    alyssa "Well at least you figured out how to change your clothes.  If you'd shown up in the suit, I would've just died.  But hey, you look all right."

I wave to her, and she sees me.  Her expression isn't a happy one.  Her cheeks grow red and she trudges over, grabbing me by the arm and dragging me away from the rest.

    alex "So is there a, uh, changing booth or something I can use?"

    "She puts a hand to her forehead and doesn't reply for a moment."

    "I begin to notice that there's something just a little. . .different about her appearance.  For a moment I can't quite put my finger on it; the roar of the crowd distracts me while we jostle our way inside.  But then I brush up against her and it hits me.  Her image in this virtual world is just a bit more . . .suggestive.  Her feminine endowments had been given quite the generous enlargement and her clothing hugs her newly defined curves quite well.  I certainly had no objections to this.  I guess our appearance in this world is altered by our own self-image.  Did it work both ways?"

    "I wondered if I looked different to her at all.  If I did, I hoped it was also for the better."

    "We passed through the gates and into the wide open maw of the tournament hall.  The lights are cast down on the center stage, waiting for the challengers to arrive.  An electric thrum runs throughout the crowd, which is packed around the stage.  Everyone is leaning forward and watching intently, though no one is there to watch yet.  The crowd, with its sheer energy and excitement, was likely to be just as much of a spectacle as the show itself."

    "The anticipation is almost like a sentient being occupying the air as we take our seats and join the rest of the masses-watching hawk-eyed for any signs of life to enter the stage."

    "\"THREEEEE MINUTES TO SHOWTIME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  PLEASE FIND YOUR SEATS AND PREPARE FOR THE SHOW.\" calls out the disembodied voice of the announcer, stirring up another uproarious reaction from the crowd.  There was another couple a little ways down from us, their arms intertwined.  I moved a little closer to Alyssa and took her hand in my own, letting our fingers intertwine.  She jumps a little at the gesture, probably not expecting it; we don't hold hands all that much, mostly because the parties she drags to aren't really the hand holding type.  She grins and flexes her fingers around mine.  It was nice to be like a normal couple for once."

    "Perhaps I should have come along with her to one of these before; she really seemed happy to be here, and hopefully my presence was part of that.  She was animated and glowing with excitement and anticipation.  I could feel the hum of the crowd coursing throughout my chest."

    alex "Wow, this place is crazy!"

    alyssa "WHAAAT?"

    "She puts a hand to her ear.  She can't hear me.  I don't blame her, I could barely hear myself."

    alex "I SAID, THIS PLACE IS CRAZY!"

    alyssa "CRAZY GOOD, OR CRAZY BAD?"

    alex "CRAZY GOOD . . . I THINK."

    "I still wasn't ready to admit to being sold on it yet, but the sheer exhilaration of the crowd was infectious at the very least."

    "Alyssa starts to reply, but her words are drowned out by the announcer."

    announcer "Laaaaaadies and gentlemeeeen, we are pleased to have you all here for the [tournament_date] Monthly Virtuality Tournament!  Tonight is a veeeeery special night, as we once again see the return of the scorching hot mage who's been blazing his way up the charts."

    "The audience is unsure whether to laugh or groan at his puns, and so it settles for somewhere in the middle."

    announcer "Will tonight be the night Silver Phoenix is reduced to ashes for good?  Or will he rise from the flames again and continue his flight up to the heavens?"

    "He pauses for a moment, and I realize that for the first time since we'd entered the building, the crowd was near silent, hanging on the man's every words."

    announcer "Weeeeell, Virtuality fans?"

    "The spell was broken and the masses erupted into thunderous clapping and stomping pierced by hoots and hollers and sharp whistles."

    announcer "But before we see our beloved mage, we'll have to find out who his opponent for the night will be first.  Let's give a waaaaarm welcome to tonight's competitors!"

    "The crowd cheers as ten opponents of wildly varied appearances file out on stage.  They waved to the crowd, vying for their affection. Some pull off little tricks and flips or flex to show their strength.  Each show evokes a new outburst of excitement from the crowd.  When the roar finally dies down, each contestant is introduced by name, and all but two, one mage and one warrior, are shuffled back out of the arena.  The remaining mage and warrior continue to play up the crowd until the announcer calls for silence.  The first fight is set to begin."

    "A series of tones sound.  One... two...three... The mage and the warrior begin their clash at the third, both striking the same time.  The warrior-type character turns out to have a monk-like close combat concentration without any physical weapons.  He dashes in and tries to engage the mage, but is deterred several times by a gigantic ice wall the mage summons to completely surround himself.  The mage's  face is reflected from the inside, warped by the layers of ice like pieces of a shattered mirror.  After several moments the monk appears to have given up and walks away from the giant ice-shield only to turn on his heel and charge it, fists forward.  He hits the wall hard and it shatters, pieces of ice are sent scattering all over the air, glittering and flashing light all over the room.  It truly is a gorgeous  sight to behold."

    "The ice mage is entirely stunned by this turn of events, and is caught off-guard when the monk charges once more, this time for him.  He is pinned to the wall hard enough to create an impact and the match is mercifully called to a quick end after he raises a hand in surrender. "

    "I realized I had been right there with the crowd during the moments of tension.  Sure, I hadn't been hollering at the top of my lungs, or at all, but I felt with them somehow.   I guess I couldn't continue to deny that some part of me was enjoying this. I am beginning to understand: there was both beauty and excitement to be found in these fights."

    "The rest of the preliminary fights progress in much the same way.  Some of the fights are unceremoniously quick like the first one, and others are a true spectacle to watch as the fighters pull out their most extraordinary tricks-the kind over the top, eye-catching techniques that one expects to see performed in a TV show or a video game, not right before their eyes. "

    "When all was said and done, a rogue-type warrior is to be Silver Phoenix's opponent.  Despite using a combat style relying on subtlety and planning and not the outward strength or flashy tricks of his opponents, he had managed to come out on top.  He seemed to have a fair following within the crowd as well, though not near as much as the champion fighter whom he was about to face."

    "The lights are brought down low as the rogue, who went by the name of \"Valsaar\", is directed to stand at the center of the arena."

    announcer "Laaaaadies and Gentlemeeeen.  It's finally time for the event you've aaaaall been waiting for.  Time for Silver Phoenix to take the stage and face this new challenger.  Will this be the end of his reign, or will the young rogue who scrambled his way up here tonight be yet another to fall at the hands of the unbeatable mage? Let's not wait any longer, ladies and gentlemen!  Let's bring out our mage!"

    "There was some sort of fanfare to accompany the reigning champion's entrance, but there probably wasn't a single soul in that room who could hear it over the cumulative uproar of the crowd.  The camera focused on him as he brusquely steps out, not bothering with any of the attention-grabbing stunts of the opponents before him.  He didn't need all that-he already had them hanging on his every step.  Lithe, like a tiger overseeing his kingdom, he walks out to the middle.  The tails of his robe ended in a series of thick fire-colored plumes that curls upward and bounces as he walks.  The camera focuses on his face, which is flushed with pure determination. He lifts his chin and tips his head left and right, sizing up his opponent."

    "The screen flips over to Valsaar in a not-so-flattering close up; from that distance it is easy to see the dread he was fighting to hide.  His own personal cheering section has long been drowned out."

    "Slowly it seems to dawn on the crowd that the fight could not begin until they quiet down.  The noise begins to drop off until it once again reaches that tension-saturated silence."
    "The signal sounds for the fight to begin."

    "The Phoenix does not waste a second; as soon as the fight begins, he snaps into action with incredible speed.  A bolt of lightning fires from each fingertip as he leaps backward into the air.  The center ones hit the space where his opponent is standing, creating a small explosion.  A great CRACK is heard as it flares up into a fire great enough to consume Valsaar."

    "As the fire blazes, a cry is heard.  But it is not one of pain.  Rather, it comes from behind the mage as Valsaar rushes him wielding a curved pair of crimson-bladed swords.  The edge of his coat is charred and still burning at the tips."

    "Just as the hit was about to connect, the mage creates an explosive barrier of flame seeded with tendrils of lighting that bursts outward.  The rogue avoids this one, jumping nimbly back in a way that would not be possible in the real world."

    "As he lands he finds himself amidst another battery of fire attacks-this time in the form of daggers.  The rogue whips his arms back suddenly  and the next set of daggers fall flat in midair before reaching him.  Opposite him, the mage stands with arms caught in midair looking paralyzed.  There is a rush of awe and confusion from the crowd.  I see a look of bemusement cast across Alyssa's face."

    "A set of silver strings becomes visible glinting in the lights.  They run from between the fingers of the rogue to where they are wrapped around the mage's arms, legs, and body.  Valsaar tugs them tighter and the mage is hopelessly entwined in the threads.  His arms are pulled taut to his sides."

    "The rogue toys around with him, pulling him forward and from one side to the other like some sort of cruel dog walker.  He makes the mistake, however, of reeling the mage in far enough so that they are almost nose to nose.  The mage quickly pulls back his head and headbutts him in a way that must have been painful for both."

    "It is at this moment, when the two are sent reeling to the ground I begin to wonder if \"pain\" could be felt in this world.  I assumed that if it could, it was blunted somehow.  Surely they wouldn't let us feel the full effect of being engulfed in flames or encased in ice.  But it seemed like fighting would be too simple if one could not feel the repercussions of it.  I try to file it away in my list of things to ask Alyssa about later, or perhaps, to experience for myself."

    "The rogue becomes entangled in his own wires and is beaten by the mage in the struggle to break free.  He is still wriggling like a caterpillar in a cocoon when the mage steps over him, hand cast downward.  He continues to struggle for a second more and then his shoulders go lax.  He tips his head forward in surrender. "

    "A victory tone sounds and the fight is over.  The mage looks up and scans the crowd.  There isn't a look of arrogance or smugness as he does so, as though what he did was perfectly normal and not worthy of praise.  His gaze pauses in our general direction and I get my first good look at his face.  He does not seem to approve of all the attention; instead, he seems irritated somehow."

    "Why was he so different from all the other fighters we had witnessed that night? "

    #TODO [Scene change]"

    alex "H-hey, slow down.  You're gonna lose me!"

    "Alyssa rolls her eyes and latches onto my arm with a hawk-like grip as we continue to shunt our way through the crowd.  She parts the wall of people with no mercy towards those in her way."

    alyssa "Well then move faster.  I'm not gonna miss him because you're so slow."

    alex "How do you know you'll even get to talk to him?  Everyone is probably trying to!"

    alyssa "But he totally looked my way after he won."

    alex "I don't think he could have been looking at you.  There were too many people for him to pick out just one person."

    alyssa "Shut up, I know what I saw!  Besides, he knows us.  He knows about our fan club and everything."

    "And the dozens other like it, I'm sure."

    alex "Hey, where is-"

    "Before I can finish my question, we are rushed by several other girls calling out Alyssa's name and latching onto us, creating our own little bubble in the crowd.  There is a rush of acknowledgement and high-pitched squeals of excitement that I cannot quite follow, but from what I can tell, they are a part of the \"fan club\"."

    "I don't know how she knows where we are going, or where to go in the first place, but Alyssa leads us like a mage-seeking missile through the thickening crowd.  We finally begin to start hearing direct call-outs to the mage, and know that he is near.  Alyssa's aggressiveness seems to increase tenfold with his proximity.  We muscle our way to the front, where the mage appears to be protected by a barely visible wall that prevents the rabid fangirls #(and fanguys) from rushing him.  A few fraught individuals are pressing themselves up against the field, which I'm sure was providing an \"interesting\" view for the mage."

    "Along the wall were the other competitors surrounded by similar fields and their respective fan-bases.  Of course, the groups surrounding them are a bit less unruly with a few exceptions, allowing for a respectable Question and Answer session.  The competitors seem grateful for any attention they get.  The champion, on the other hand. . ."

    "He seems to be enduring the cacophonic shouts of admiration while visibly working to hide some degree of distaste .  If he were a cat, I could imagine his ears flattened back, back slightly arched.  I wonder why he even bothers to put himself through this."

    alyssa "HEY.  HEY, MISTER MAGE.  IT'S US – THE SILVER SISTERS!  REMEMBER US?  WE LOVE YOUUUU!"

    "Her shouts blend into all the many like it.  Adjacent to us I can see another faction of fan girls turn and competitive glares are exchanged between them and the sub-members of Alyssa's group.  Alyssa's focus is too laser-guided for her to even notice them."

    "After several more fruitless shouts Alyssa begins to get frustrated.  Frustrated, but not discouraged of course.  She elbows me sharply."

    alyssa "Hey, aren't you gonna help us?"

    alex "M-me?  But I'm not even a fan."

    alyssa "You're a fan of me, aren't you?  So if you're a fan of me then you must be a fan of him."

    "I ignore the fact that this makes no sense, not wanting to risk another elbow jab.  Unenthusiastically, I join in with their desperate fan-girl cries.  To my surprise, his head eventually turns in our direction.  A questioning eyebrow is raised  and he lifts his hand to give us a subtle \"come here\" gesture to our group and several others like it.  All of them female, of course."

    "We begin to step forward.  The field surrounding him bends a little as we approach it, making it clear that it will allow us to pass.  Before we can go through it, however, the mage holds up a hand signaling \"stop\".  I begin to think he may have changed his mind, but then he points to the other girls from the club and motions them away along with two more from another group."

    "They look like sad little puppies abandoned on the side of the road.  Alyssa doesn't seem too upset over this, and pats one on the shoulder, promising to \"tell them all about it later\".  I don't think this is as much of a consolation as she thinks it is."

    "We start forward again and he once more raises a hand.  This time he looks at me with one eyebrow raised."

    alyssa "Alex, why don't you wait here?  We can catch up later or something."

    alex "What?  You're just gonna leave me behind?  I thought this was a \"date\"?"

    "She looks at me in annoyance at being trapped by her own words.  The mage is growing impatient as are the other girls.  They are practically pawing at the force field, waiting to be let through."

    alyssa "Fine.  But you better not embarrass me.  She speaks to the mage directly.  Um, Mr. Phoenix?  Could you please let my friend in too?  He's here with me."

    
    "\"Friend\".  The word stings a little. "

    alex " Actually, I'm her-"

    "Alyssa elbows me.  Hard.  The mage's eyebrow still remains raised as he looks from me to her."

    alyssa "I promise he won't get in the way."

    "He nods slowly, expression unchanged.  Alyssa grabs my arm, her nails digging in, as we move closer. She gives me a look that says \"this is your last warning\"."

    "The cluster of girls plus me pass through the field, leaving me to wonder: \"why us?\""
    "The mage turns and leads us through a door behind him, leaving behind a disappointed crowd.  Behind the door is a red-lit lounge with refreshments waiting.  They are not the only thing waiting; a party of young men and women, clearly not just ordinary fans, are there too.  When we step inside, they all soundlessly center themselves around the mage, looking at us with mild curiosity.  They are dressed in high-fashion formalwear that sets them apart from the masses out there clamoring to get inside.  They are \"refined\" and look down upon the newcomers with eagle eyes while speaking to the mage in flattering tones."

    silver "So then, what did you all think of the fight?"

    alex "It was actually-"

    "He raises a finger to his lips."

    silver "Shhhh.  Let the ladies speak first."

    "...but he asked what we \"all\" thought.  But whatever.  Why did it matter to me?  This was Alyssa's thing anyway. I was nothing like these girls, fawning all over some virtual idol."

    "All the girls try to speak at once, and there is a dissonant joining of voices for several seconds before one voice beats them all out.  Of course it was Alyssa's."

    alyssa "OHMYGOSH, it was awesome!  The best.  The way you sent out those firebolts, like KSSSSHHHH "

    "She makes a gesture that is somehow meant to embody the sound \"ksshhh\"."

    alyssa "... it was like, WOW.  Probably your coolest-looking fight yet.  No one fights with style like you do."

    silver "So, you're a long-time fan, huh?"

    "He smiles and steps a little closer toward Alyssa and I. Was it me or was she stepping even further away from me?"

    "The other girls he had invited begin to exchange covetous looks with each other.  Alyssa seems oblivious to all of this."
    alyssa "Oh, yeah!  Ever since the beginning-even before your first big-time fight.  I always knew you'd be great."

    silver "Really?  So were you there for my fight with the Berserker?"

    alyssa " The one where he had you all pinned down with his axe, and at the last second you created that GIGANTIC wall of flames to push him back.  That was amazing!  You created that in less than a second, and all of a sudden you were on your feet, blitzing him with lightning bolts."

    silver "Wow, what a keen-eyed fan you are."

    alyssa "I have a scrapbook at home with records of all of your fights.  I know the stats for each one.  Did you know that you once finished a fight in TWELVE-point-two seconds?  That's actually still the record in that arena."

    silver "Truly?  I did not know that."

    "He smiles and places a hand on her shoulder.  I can see the fan girl in her just about keel over from an emotional overload. That does not stop her, however.  I could feel the heat rushing to my cheeks."
    "Was I really just going to stand here and watch this?"

    "Alyssa continues to gush on for several minutes about the fight and him in general, and for once he seems to be enjoying it.  Alyssa pauses just long enough to ask me to get her something to drink, which I gladly do because standing there listening to her enthuse about some other guy wasn't exactly my idea of a good time."

    "When I return the circle of devotees has closed around the mage making it difficult to see where Alyssa was now standing.  I push them brusquely out of place to find her in the center. The mage's arm is wrapped firmly around her waist.  My hand tightens around the glass."

    alex "Alyssa."

    "Alyssa looks up and giggles a little before stepping away and taking the glass from my hand without even a \"thank you\".  I want to step in, but I figure she'd never talk to me again if I said anything against her idol."

    "I stand there with a glare concentrated on him.  It does not go unnoticed."

    silver "Who are you, again?"
    "He looks me directly in the eyes with an almost playful grin occupying his lips.  Alyssa cuts in before I have a chance to speak."

    alyssa "Oh, don't worry about him.  He's no big deal."

    silver "Is that so?"

    "He turns to me with eyebrows raised and shakes his head. "
    silver "I'm sorry, my friend, I guess the lady doesn't think too much of you."

    "And that is that.  The conversation continues without me, and I just fade into the background.  What was I doing here?  Why was I putting up with this?  No big deal?  Seriously?"

    "My face grows heated and I try to keep myself under control.  I was never the hot-headed type, but perhaps I'd never had something to be 'hot-headed' about before.  I clutch my glass so tightly that I start to believe I might crush it."

    "There is more talking, but my immersion in the whole event has already been shattered by this incident.  Perhaps I'm just overreacting. "

    "No, what am I thinking?  I have a right to be angry."

    "I watch Alyssa squirm her way back into the mage's arms within just a few minutes.  She doesn't even give me a second glance."

    "The anger fulminates inside of me, battering its way through my stomach like a trapped beast, threatening to tear through my chest. Keep it together. . ."

    "In another playful move, the mage gently tugs Alyssa off-balance so that she falls against his chest.  Before I know it, I am watching him with his lips pressed against hers and she is doing nothing to resist it.  She brings her arms up to encircle his neck and leans even further into the kiss."

    "This time, I will not just stand idle.  I can't stand idle.  The anger takes control and I grab the mage roughly by the shoulder and push him away.  Alyssa stumbles back in surprise.  There are a few gasps from the others in the room as their circle moves back, but they do not rush to stop me."

    alyssa "Alex, what the hell are you doing? "

    "I realize that my hand is still latched onto his shoulder.  He does not act, only stares down emotionless at me.  Cold.  Uncaring.  His eyes mock me.  Or perhaps they don't.  Maybe it's just me."

    "It's all blurring together now.  The room, the people, even his stupid face.  I didn't deserve to be shoved aside like this, ignored."

    "I know that my anger is mostly misdirected.  Alyssa was the one who had shoved me off as a \"nobody\".  But here, right in front of me, was a perfect target for my rage-one I had no qualms about taking my anger out on."
    "I realize that my other hand is curled into a fist.  It goes sailing towards his face without any conscious thought on my part.  The hit connects, but not with the side of his pretty-boy face as intended.  It hits the outstretched palm held in front of it.  We grapple and he sends me reeling backward to the floor."

    "Of course.  What had I been thinking?"

    "I am pinned down by several of his \"firebolts\", which pierce through my clothes.  I receive the answer to my question as to whether or not pain can be felt in this virtual world.  The answer is a resounding yes."

    silver "If you wanted a fight, you should have met me in the arena."

    "The corner of his mouth twitches."

    silver "But I doubt an unremarkable guy like you could have even made it to the preliminaries."

    "He releases me and turns away while I stumble to my feet. The wind has been knocked out of me, and my cheeks are still flushing from anger and embarrassment.  Alyssa does not look happy either."

    alyssa "Geez, Alex.  It was just one kiss-what does it matter?"

    "She doesn't give me a chance to argue, to defend myself.  I don't get to tell her she's wrong.  She just turns away and goes back to the mage as though nothing had happened.  As though that was her rightful place now."

    "That mage...The guy was probably just some old perv in real life, taking advantage of the anonymity of a virtual world.  Just some creep.  I was sick of being undervalued by people like him.  Him AND Alyssa."

    "That guy . . ."

    "It took four years, but I did it.  I clawed my way to the top."

    "Right from the beginning it wasn't easy, mostly because I didn't know why I was doing it.  It wasn't for Alyssa.  I was intelligent enough to know that she wasn't worth it.  Maybe it was because there was some truth in what he said.  Maybe I lacked my own identity.  I was just a weak and faceless nobody, destined to fade into the crowd; a tagalong."

    "Well I was out to prove him wrong."

    "I lost eleven ranked matches before I ever won one.  A smarter person would have given up and seen the futility after the first few, but I suppose I just wasn't that guy."

    "I had chosen a warrior-based class and modeled my armor and fighting style after that of a paladin. A greatsword became my weapon of choice.  It was not an easy path to take.  Even though it all took place in virtual space, to become competitive took an immense amount of mental power and dexterity.  Even though your body was not physically doing the actions, you had to be able to command your virtual one as though it were."

    "There was a certain rush that came with wielding such power, even knowing it wasn't real.  I wanted nothing more than to catch up to Silver Phoenix and show him this new power I have; to show him that I'm not just forgettable-That I'm someone."

    "The first competitive match I ever won was against a mage.  It was also my first fight ever against a mage-type character.  Perhaps it was what spurred me on, although this mage was nothing like Silver Phoenix."

    "This mage was dressed in a simple white robe with no embellishments whatsoever.  A hood hid the mage's face, but the figure was unmistakably female and heavily \"enhanced\"."

    "My heart was railing against my chest.  I could feel it, even in Virtuality.  I was braced for another loss, but something told me that wouldn't be the case that time.  I wouldn't let myself be bested by another mage.  Not again."

    "Everything had suddenly gone quiet.  A set of three tones signaled the start of the fight."

    "She stood in place with her arms crossed while I began circling, sword held in front.  Her head turned ever so slightly to follow my movements, her sharp little chin just peeking out from her hood.  She was a petite one, but not to be underestimated.  A mage relied on their mental prowess far more than they did their physical strengths; her thin figure wouldn't hinder her as long as she could stay out of my reach."

    "I waited for the perfect moment and rushed without warning, greatsword held high.  The moment I was about to bring it down on her head a shockwave rippling outward from her body repelled the attack, sending me back against the far wall of the arena.  Pain coursed through me as she took a hefty bite out of my hit points.  It didn't feel like ordinary, real world pain. It was a draining sort of pain; a restricting pain that threatened to drag me down and stop me.  It was its own type of hurt."

    "The mage waited patiently for me to struggle loose from the surrounding wall and retrieve my weapon.  I didn't need her to take pity on me, to just let me go like that.  I would have been fine."

    announcer "SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF AN HONORABLE FIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN!"

    "I was back on my feet and the mage was still standing proud.  It seemed as though the fight had gone back to the start-the mage smirking, and I circling around her.  Again, I broke into a rush, and again I could see the mage bracing herself for the counterattack."

    "This time I was ready.  My sword came down heavy on the barrier, keeping it from expanding and pushing me back.  There was struggle,  brought up on a large screen for the audience.  Both of us quivered as we tried to outmatch the other.  There was uproar on behalf of each side, a jumble of names and monikers being screamed from the crowd as the announcer tried to comment on the action.  It seemed to go on forever, long after both of us should have collapsed from exhaustion."

    "One of us finally broke."

    "My broadsword cleaved through the barrier and made contact with the mage.  I hit her at a critical point with a heavy blow; her hit points were depleted completely.  The fight was over and she crumpled to the floor, her hood falling loose to reveal a delicate face.  It was kind of face you'd expect to see peeking out from behind a book, not at the end of blade that was almost larger than herself."

    "Not the mage.  Not the one I was looking for.  But it was a start."

    "After that, I began to ascend the ranks at an ever-increasing speed.  I didn't have the perfect win record that the mage I was chasing after did, but that didn't matter.  All that mattered that I was getting closer.  Since I was so \"forgettable\" last time, he probably didn't even recognize my name or face, but I would make sure that he would remember it this time."

    "Soon he would be the forgettable one, scraping for the recognition that he once had and drowning in the anonymity."

    "Eventually, I reached the peak.  I was ready to face him-hell, I was ready to beat him."

    "And that's when he did it.  As though it were part of some cruel joke, he suddenly stepped away from it all-retired.  He disappeared from the tournament life without a word as to why.  Did he lose interest?  Or was he afraid of being beaten by me?"

    "I had suddenly reached the top, but only by default.  I didn't get my moment of triumph, or revenge, or whatever it was all for.  I felt cheated. "

    "I had everything else that he ever had.  They cheered my name just as much as they ever did his.  I even had the fan clubs-the girls.  I dated some of them from time to time.  It never had any meaning; it was just another part of the job, but it was another sort of \"fun\", I guess.  I just knew I wouldn't be happy until I'd finally gotten what I'd set out for in the first place.  That mage.  I looked all over for him, for every scrap of information I could find."

    "Someone leaked that he was off doing technical things; locality research and programming, but no one seemed to know just where to find him and he always kept his player status set to invisible to make himself untraceable.  It was maddening."

    "I kept going, kept defending my championship, but for what?  Was I happy now?"

    "I truly did enjoy the fighting-it made me feel more alive than anything I'd ever done in real life.  But what had I lost along the way?  I'd dropped out of the university shortly after I began my training because it took up too much of my time.  By then I could have had a real world job-a high paying one, too.  The type I'd always dreamed of-but somehow I'd gotten derailed by this game."

    "I loved it, and I found freedom in it.  But I hadn't achieved my goal yet, and it seemed like I never would. "

    "I was stuck."

    alex "Look, my autograph signing hand is a bit sore right now, so-"

    "I look up and catch a glimpse of this \"fan\" and stop short.  This isn't some bothersome preteen or screaming fangirl.  It's THE mage.  Silver Phoenix.  I have to fight the urge to reconnect my fist with his pretty-boy face."

    alex "It's you."

    "No catchy first line for me."

    silver "Leaving the tournament biz, eh?  Finally tire of it like I did?"

    alex "Tired?  You left because you were tired of it?  You couldn't have just stayed for a little longer?"

    silver "Whoa, now, what's this all about?"

    alex ". . .Nothing.  So what are you here for if you're done fighting?  And why the heck were you eavesdropping on me?"

    silver "Well, first of all, if you wanted a private conversation, there are better places to have it than a public area.  And second of all, I came here because I thought you might be useful to me.  And if you're leaving the tournament scene you might appreciate what I'm about to offer you. "

    alex "And what is that?"

    silver "My, you're so snappy.  Are you that bitter that you never got your shot at me?"

    "If only you knew... I shoot him a look.  This wasn't the time to spill my guts to him now."

    silver "Anyway. . . you're a full-time player, am I right?  Well as your assistant so helpfully pointed out, by retiring from the tournaments you're losing a major source of income.  I'm here to offer you a job where we have the means to pay you quite the decent salary-more than you're making now, in fact. "

    alex "What makes you think I'm that hard up for cash that I need to go crawling to you for it.  There are plenty of other jobs out there."

    silver "Well I thought you might appreciate a job that goes above those meaningless and repetitive fights.  Something with purpose.  I'm sure the rumors have gotten around as to what I've been up to and I-"

    alex "No thanks.  Why don't you go find some of your worshipers to do the job?  I'm sure they'd be happy to have their god pluck them up and spirit them away into your world."

    "He frowns and looks down his nose at me."

    silver "We have more than enough average and low-level players.  What we need are the top-tier, and all those players are too involved with competitive play to have time."

    alex "So, what?  You're saying you need me?"

    "I can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation.  Silver Phoenix, of course raises an eyebrow at me.  Just like old times, except the roles were reversed.  Somehow I was top dog.  But I still wasn't satisfied.  Not until he understood it himself."

    silver "Yes, yes.  It's hilarious.  Now can we wrap up the childish antics and get down to business?"

    alex "Wait, can't we please take a moment to acknowledge the fact that the \"Great Silver Phoenix\" is coming to a lowly peon like me for help?"

    "He crosses his arms and looks to the side, not amused."

    silver "Well I, and many others it seems, actually think quite highly of you.  Perhaps we were wrong to think so, because you seem like an arrogant prick to me."

    alex "Woah, now, insults aren't going to get me on board."

    silver "Look, I don't need you.  You could be useful, but you certainly aren't necessary."
    silver "But would you show some consideration for all the other players out there?  These tests could improve the game a lot.  Besides, I thought you might appreciate the opportunity.  Regrettably, however, it seems I was wrong."

    "He starts to turn away, looking flustered.  I see my chance."

    alex "Well there is one thing that might make me reconsider."

    "He looks back at me, eyebrow arched."

    silver "Oh?  And just what is that."

    alex "Fight me.  One last fight for both of us in the tournament hall."

    "This time both his eyebrows are raised in utter surprise."

    silver "You want me to fight you?  What is the point of that?"

    alex "It doesn't matter.  Just do it and then I'll work for you, or whatever it is you want."

    silver "Well now, I'm afraid that I will have to decline.  You just don't interest me as an opponent.  No one does anymore.  That's why I retired in the first place.  Just person after person.  There was no heart in it.  The imaginative fighters that once populated the arenas have all moved onto other things now that they've been crowded out by people who overanalyze things such as stats to come up with the \"optimum\" equipment and skill-set.  When the only goal is winning, the entire thing is ruined."

    ". . .He thinks there would be no heart in our fight?  No heart?!  If only he knew.  I consider just throwing my whole story in his face.  Maybe then he'd see just how much \"heart\" our battle would have.  But it was just not how I envisioned it."

    silver "I won't fight you. . .but my offer still stands if you happen to change your mind."

    "He hands me a small silver card with a location printed on it."

    silver "Here is where to find me.  It's a limited access area, but I will have your user information placed in the system so you'll have no trouble at all getting in."

    "He turns with a flippant wave."

    silver "I will be expecting you soon."

    "I continue to stare at the translucent card in my hand.  What the hell was happening?"

    #TODO [Scene change-In Alex's own private Virtuality quarters] "
    "I swivel back and forth in the cozy black desk chair, arms crossed.  It's funny, that with all the amazing things I could do in Virtuality, sometimes it was the mundane comforts that often enveloped my time."

    alex "[avatar_name], do you think I made the right choice, turning down Silver Phoenix like that?"

    "Faithful as ever, she appears by my side."

    avatar "But sir, did we not discuss this yesterday?  Have we not been discussing it for the past three days?"

    "Perhaps not that faithful.  She wasn't afraid to argue."

    alex "Well I'd like to discuss it again.  What do you think?  Should I have accepted his offer?  Maybe I'd have already gotten my fight with him by now, if-"

    avatar "But, sir, yesterday you once again came to the conclusion that you made the correct choice.  You said-"

    alex "I didn't ask for a transcript, [avatar_name].  I asked what you thought."

    avatar "I'm sorry, but I'm not capable of giving an \"opinion\", only a calculation based on facts and observations."

    alex "Whatever, just give me any kind of input.   I'm sick of talking to myself."

    avatar "Very well."

    "Her eyes go blank as she \"analyzes\" the information.  After a moment, she returns to normal."

    avatar "Well my calculations show that you would be more likely to coerce him into an arena battle if you were working closely with him.  Merely keeping a watch on him seems to have had no significant effect."

    alex "So you're saying that I should have taken his offer."

    "Duh, even I knew that.  The card is still lying on the corner of my desk.  It's not too late. . .But I just can't see myself working for him."

    avatar "I'm detecting some arrhythmia.  Perhaps you should take a break and work on a more mundane task?  Perhaps checking your 37 unread emails. . .9 of which are from tournament officials asking you to reconsider your retirement. . ."

    "A look of deep annoyance starts to settle on my face."

    avatar ". . .Right, something else then."

    "She begins to act flustered when I look at her skeptically.  I know her behavior is all just part of a program; if I want her to be straight-laced and all-business, she can be, but I find this much more amusing."

    "A musical tone begins to sound from the screen at my desk and it flashed, telling me I had a call.  The caller ID displays the word \"Mom\" along with an old picture of her and Dad.  I answer the call."

    alex "Hey, Mom, what's up?  I'm a little surprised to see you calling right now.  I thought you would be-"

    "I freeze with the words \"at work\" still hanging in my mouth.  There is a pained expression on her face."

    alex "Mom, what's going on?"

    mom "Alex . . . "

    "She doesn't really continue, just lets my name hang there.  Something isn't right.  She sniffles a little and I can see the dried tear stains running down her cheeks."

    alex "Is everything okay?"

    "Of course it isn't."

    mom "I have some bad news.  Now, I don't want you to worry too much, but. . ."

    alex "Please just tell me already.  You're making me worry more by not telling me."

    mom "Well. . . "

    "She bites her lip and scrunches up her eyebrows."

    mom "Dad's in the hospital right now."

    "She couldn't hold it in any more.  She leans forward, cupping her head in her hands.  Her shoulders jerk every few seconds as she begins sobbing."

    alex "What?  Why?  Is he okay?"

    "She takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself enough to speak."

    mom "He's fine for the moment, but his heart is having some trouble right now.  They said it was some sort of cardiovascular disease or whatever, something to do with his heart.  A combination of his smoking, and the way he eats, and the stress from everything else. . . I don't know, I couldn't really follow.  And I suppose it doesn't really matter now."

    alex "But he's okay?"

    mom "They had to do some surgery, but he's . . . okay.  There could still be some problems.  We'll have to keep a watch on him, cut down on some of his bad habits and change his diet a little, but he should be able to go home in a few days.  He's resting right now."

    "There's some trepidation left in her voice."

    alex " Come on, Mom.  I can tell that there's something else."

    "She sighs, her breath crackling through the line."

    mom "I'm just a little worried about the medical bills we'll be getting and, well, with his paycheck we were just getting by even before all this.  It's going to be tough, that's all."

    alex "Oh, Mom. . ."

    "I don't really know what to say.  I worry for her sometimes."

    mom "But right now I shouldn't be worrying about all that.  I should be happy that he's okay.  I was so worried that he might. . .he might. . ."

    alex "I know, Mom, it's okay."

    "Her tone suddenly brightened, but I could tell that it was forced.  She didn't want to worry me, so she was going to shoulder all the worry, just like always.  No, I couldn't let her do that."

    alex "Mom, if you're worried about the money, then I'll pitch in however I can, okay?  I don't want you getting stressed out over the bills – you already have Dad to worry about."

    mom "Thank you, Alex, but really, it will be fine.  You have loans to pay off still, and you and I both know that money's been tight for you, too."

    "She knew as well as I did that I had been a little flippant with my newfound wealth.  I was already taking a big hit in legal fees for breaking my contract with the tournament hall so suddenly.  In other words, I didn't have much money to throw around anymore."

    mom "Maybe we can get together a fundraiser or something, I don't know."

    "I could feel the depression leeching in through her tone, and I was reminded of a time when I was in high school and my dad was in between jobs; she had gone through a severe bout of depression then, the kind where the despair over our situation-balancing my sister and I, and trying to manage our home life-had left he like a car stuck in the mud, hopelessly spinning tires, for several months.  I didn't want to see her end up like that again. "

    mom " –Besides, you still have a good twenty years or so before you should be looking after us.  You should be out living your own life right now, worrying about yourself.  Be a little selfish once and a while."

    "I already am selfish.  I realized just how much I'd lost contact with them in the past few years.  I can't even remember the last time I'd visited that wasn't for a holiday.  She's right though.  I don't really have that much to give, and definitely not anything that will make a difference."

    "I glance back at the card on my desk.  It glints at me like it knows the answer."

    alex "No, Mom, really-it's okay.  I want to help.  I . . ."

    "I grit my teeth a little. Dammit.  It's an opportunity I just can't ignore.  I would be selfish to."

    alex ". . .I know a way I can make some good money."

    mom "No, honey, don't worry about us, I'm sure we'll make it through all right. "

    "Her stifled sobs said otherwise.  I knew that they had plenty of other expenses to take care of still, and my dad's position at his company had been shaky at best for the past few years; they probably wouldn't do much to help out financially while he was recovering.  Plus they had my sister's college expenses to keep up with.  I knew they wouldn't be able to do it alone, at least not without a lot of hardship.  I didn't want them to go through that."

    alex "You don't worry about it mom-I'm going to help out because I want to, not because I have to.  End of story.  So try not to stress yourself out too much, okay?  I'll make sure everything's okay."

    mom "O-okay, Alex."

    "She sighs heavily again, and I couldn't tell if it was relief or just the weight of it all crushing down on her still."

    mom "You've always been such a good boy."

    "We talk for a while longer.  Mom tries to steer the conversation towards lighter subjects, but I was only half-involved in the conversation.  I was too busy thinking about what I would have to do."

    "I'd been hoping that Silver Phoenix would come seek me out again, this time begging me for my assistance, but he hadn't.  Now it seems I would be the one bowing my head to him."
    "But what choice did I have?  I was cornered.  Unless. . ."

    "I recall all the emails that I'd gotten from the tournament officials since I quit.  Thus far, I'd ignored them, but maybe they were still desperate for someone to fill the spot.  I didn't like the thought of going back to them either, but. . ."

    alex "[avatar_name], could you read me the most recent email from the Vega City Tournament Hall council?"

    avatar "Right away, sir. "

    "She looks away momentarily as she retrieves the information from my account and begins to read."

    avatar "It seems this is from eight days ago. It reads:  \"Dear Mr. Alex Bishop, we hope this message finds you well and in good health.  On behalf of the Vega City Tournament Hall, we would like to apologize for the recent misgivings between us, and hope that you understand that as a business we had to take necessary action against you in order to preserve the integrity of our company in order to continue to support our other participants.\""

    alex "\"preserve the integrity of our company,\"my ass."

    "[avatar_name] gives me a wary look, and then continued."

    avatar "\"In light of these events, we have a request to make of you.  It's no secret that your sudden departure has left us in a difficult position in regard to the structure of next month's tournament.  As you may have noticed, we have yet to formally announce your retirement to the community; we fear that there will be a large drop in attendance if we simply promote the next champion beneath you, and would like to arrange something else if at all possible.  We see this as an opportunity for you to also provide some closure to your fans with a more gradual retirement, while giving us some time to find a new face for our tournaments.\""

    "My ears perk up at this.  I could go back to them until all this gets sorted out.  Fight a few good fights and Mom won't have to worry anymore, then I can just go right back to the way things are now.  Perhaps a miracle had dropped itself into my lap."

    avatar "\"If you are willing to do this for us, we would drop all penalties incurred as a result of prematurely ending your contract.  Please-\""

    alex "What?  Why'd you stop?"

    avatar "Oh, I'm sorry, but it seems that you've just received a new email from the same sender."

    alex "Then just skip the rest and read that one."

    avatar "Right, then.  It reads:  \"Mr. Bishop, we regret to inform you that due to your childish lack of response, we were forced to resolve the issue ourselves.  We were met with some luck, and will be hosting a champion from a neighboring tournament hall.  We believe that he will be a more than adequate replacement for yourself and will stabilize our revenue projections from this month's tournament.\""

    "She blushes a little and looks uncomfortably to the side."

    avatar ". . . \"As such, your services are no longer needed, and we shall have to retract the deal we previously offered you.  We-\""

    alex "You can delete it, [avatar_name], I've heard enough. "

    "Of course.  What was I to expect from the people I'd screwed over because I simply didn't feel like keeping up with my responsibilities?"

    "[avatar_name] meekly pats me on the back.  It was comforting at a time like this, even if she was just a computer program-a cold set of code that was acting on algorithms and not real feelings.  But if it felt real to me, then wasn't that good enough?"

    avatar "Tea, sir?"

    alex "Yeah, sure."

    "I lean forward and hold my head in my hands.  I feel a headache coming on. Why all of this at once?  Why now?"

    "The silver card still sits glinting on my desk, just as much of a spectacle as its owner.  It seemed to be taunting me, a reminder that I really had no choice left.  Maybe I deserved it.  I could have had the money easy if I hadn't gone off on my own like that, consequences be damned. "

    "I pick up the card, feeling resolved to my \"fate\".  I guess it was time to make the arrangements."

    #TODO [scene change]"

    "I teleport to Silver Phoenix's office at the appointed time.  I stand there for several seconds wondering why it's taking so long to load a personal space.  Nothing has rendered-no furniture, no walls or floors . . .But then I see a slight figure ahead of me facing the other direction.  It's not difficult to figure out from the showy coat that it's Silver Phoenix.  He turns and walks closer."

    silver "So, you've decided to accept my offer after all?  I'm very glad to see it."

    "I am about to retort back, but he cuts me off with a raised hand."

    silver "No, don't worry.  I'm not going to risk taunting you; I'd rather not see you go stalking out of here in the first minute."

    "The space is still empty.  Is this truly what the great Silver Phoenix can muster?"

    alex "Geez, this place is kind of boring, isn't it?  Aren't mages supposed to have a really good  imagination?"

    "He looks around the room, eyes opened in surprise."

    silver "Oh?  And just what were you expecting?"

    alex "I don't know. . .something more refined. . .and cooler."

    "He places a hand to his chin and narrows his eyes."

    silver "Hmm.  I'll see what I can do."

    "A stylized set of furniture, along with all sorts of trophies and memorabilia make their way into the blank space, creating a room.  It all happens so fast. "
    
    silver "I prefer to keep things simple when I'm by myself.  Otherwise I find it distracting."

    "All the changes are made simultaneously, in less than a second.  A set of decorations show up to line the walls-awards, wall sculptures, and gigantic paintings, all at the same time.  The empty space is exchanged for a full polished cherry wood set of furniture.  Several bookshelves show up against the walls, all packed full, of course."

    "It was incredible.  The room now had some sense of regality and carried a new weight to it, one that demanded some sort of reverence."

    "It was amazing just how fast he had done it, recalling every object into its place with perfect ease.  No wonder why he had done so well in tournaments.  He had a strong mind-I could respect that."

    "He turns to me, grinning."

    silver "So?  Is that more to your expectations?"

    "Did he come up with that on the spot?"

    alex "Yeah. . .I guess so."

    "I try not to let my astonishment show.  No, I can't let him wow me like this.  I'll be aloof, even though I know I'm here to stay.  He doesn't need to know that yet."

    silver "I'm so glad that you changed your mind."

    "He claps his hands together, the picture of elegance."

    alex "I'm only here because of the money.   If I don't know how this is going, then I'm out.  So how much is it you're paying me again?"

    "Okay, maybe I was taking it a bit too far.  Silver Phoenix didn't seem too impressed with my attitude, but he remains as pleasant and composed as ever."

    silver "Enough.  More than you were making before."

    "I could see him fighting the urge to make a retort about my claims to not need the money the first time we met.  He must have had incredible restraint to hold it back; I don't think I could have resisted had it been me."

    silver "We can go over the figures later, hammer things out.  Besides, there are more rewarding things to gain here than money.  You can only learn so much from fighting the same battles over and over again; before long, the battles just feel the same.  Here, we will be broadening horizons, growing, learning.  Doesn't that sound much better than an inflated paycheck?"

    "I eye him a bit mistrustfully, and he catches this."

    silver "But don't worry, the payments will readily come.  I understand that money is necessary, even if it isn't fulfilling.  Enough about that.  There will be plenty of time to discuss the finer details of the project later. Well then, would you like to get started, or shall we sit down for some refreshments, first?"

    "I shrug and look to the side."

    alex "Get started?  Today?"

    silver "I see no point in waiting.  Unless you're not prepared to begin today. . .?"

    alex "Let's just do this, I guess."

    "He glances a little forlornly at the mug of some steaming drink and the tray of sweets that was set out on his desk, but shrugs back."

    silver "Well, if you're sure.  After a little while though, why don't we take a break and enjoy some tea?"

    alex "Yeah, sure, whatever. "

    "I'm determined not to relent in my attitude towards him. "

    "He motions for us to move to a corner of the room, which is fairly clear of furniture save for a couple of computer terminals.  He sits down at one of the computers and tells me to remain standing.  There was still something a little odd about computers in a virtual space, to me."

    silver "You'll have to bear with me.  Before we get into the really interesting material we need to do a bit of testing to make sure you're what I need."

    alex "Wait, what?  I thought I was what you needed?  I thought this was a guaranteed job, here."

    "What if things don't work out here?  What then?  I was starting to feel a little nervous."

    "He holds up a hand, as if in surrender."

    silver "I was just saying that as a precaution.  Truly, I am sure that you are what I need.  And if you're not, well, I'll have to work with what I've got.  Now calm down, we need some basal readings first and we won't get them with your heart jumping like a rabbit.  Blood pressure down, please.  Happy thoughts."

    "I roll my eyes, but try to comply.  Otherwise we'd be here all night."

    "He makes me go through a few breathing exercises first to get his precious \"basal readings\" and then leads me through series of tests.  Some are simple, just working with newly programmed objects to make sure they function properly.  Gradually, though, we work towards more rigorous tests and I begin to see why it was important I was there.  He asks me to pull off various stunts and moves that even the above average-level players can't.  All the while I wonder just what this is all for."

    "After a couple hours he tells me that I can relax.  We're finished.  My body feels drained from how much I'd been exerting it, but I do my best not to show it.  He invites me to take a chair next to him, and explains the point of all the tests on a technical level.  Normally I would have made a concerted effort to be obstinate with him, but I actually found what he was saying to be quite interesting."

    "He described it all in such an impassioned way; not like someone parroting out information in an attempt to sound intelligent, but as someone who was deeply excited and knowledgeable of his work.  Some people might have thought it laughable, to find satisfaction in something that's \"only a game\". I should know better than anyone-after all, I was one of those people. But having been involved with Virtuality for so long, I now knew that it was something more; it was a way of connecting people, bringing us all together in something that feels real.  It was more than just a telephone connection, or a video feed.  It played on all of the senses."

    "I felt a bit proud to know that I was helping with these improvements, to further spread the boundaries of Virtuality to new places and new people."

    "He picked up on my interest, and seemed relieved that I wasn't snapping back at him for once.  He motions for me to sit at a second computer terminal next to his."

    "His eyes scan over all the numbers."

    silver "Hmm. . ."

    "He seems to be talking to himself more than me.  In fact, I feel as though he's forgotten I was there.  I make a motion to grab his attention, and his gaze snaps back to me.  I was getting nervous again.  What if the numbers told him that I wasn't useful here?"

    alex "\"Hmm\", what?"

    silver "Oh, just some interesting things in the data we've collected from you.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at it right now."

    alex "What is it?  Is something wrong with it?"

    silver "No, no, it's perfect.  Just what I expected.  In fact it's better than I expected.  But really, I'd like to do some analyses on the data real quick, just to confirm it.  If you'd like you can stay and help."
    
    "He leans over me a little and opens a program up on the computer. "

    alex "I've never done any of this before."

    "The program is completely foreign to me.  Just a wall of numbers and commands for analyzing them."

    silver "Well I didn't intend for you to originally, but since you're here . . .  You don't have to, of course, but I'll pay you for the extra time.  I'm getting some new ideas from what I'm seeing here."

    "He can see that I'm still a little uncertain about the idea."

    silver "You'll be fine!"

    "He shakes my shoulder a little in an attempt to be reassuring."

    silver "Look, you just have to run the tests and copy the data into a new file so I can look at it more closely later.  You don't even have to know what the numbers mean, okay?"
    "I go through his instructions with the occasional bit of help from him.  He watches carefully from the side while doing his own work.  He explains a little of what I'm doing, and I feel that I am slowly getting it by the time I've run all the tests on the data."

    "I sit back in my chair, arms folded behind my head."

    silver "See?  Not so difficult."

    alex "I guess, but it's not like I could have done that by myself."

    "He shrugs as if to say: \"some folks just can't be pleased\".  He clicks a few more buttons, closing out the programs, and then leans back in his own chair with his hands folded together.  We sit there in silence for almost a minute before he breaks it."

    silver "So.  I hope you don't mind my asking, but what changed your mind?"

    "I get the urge to react negatively, but suppress it.  Still, I wasn't going to go spilling my lifestyle to him."

    alex "Well if it really matters . . . it turns out I need the money after all.  And I need it quickly, so, uh. . . you can do an advance on payment, right?"

    "I look ahead as I speak, but I can feel his eyes searching my face."

    silver "Uh-oh, got yourself in trouble?  Sounds pretty urgent.  Don't tell me it's the Mafia.  Drug money?  Alimony for your seven ex-wives getting the best of you?"

    "He clucks his tongue and smiles at me.  He was having too much fun with this."

    alex "Look, I need the money for someone else, okay?  Not me.  Otherwise I wouldn't be here."

    "He could see that it was a serious issue, and his expression morphed to one of concern."

    alex "My dad just had to have some kind of emergency surgery, and my mom's pretty worried about bills.  She's probably right to be.  I know they've been struggling.  I just want to help if I can."

    "He stops asking questions at this point.  The look of pity on his face starts to boil my blood.  I wasn't someone to be pitied, goddamn it!"

    silver "Well then, I guess that settles it.  I'll be transferring your first paycheck to your account after you leave.  I'm sure you'll find it quite substantial."

    "I swallow my anger.  He wasn't doing it to tick me off.  The smile in his eyes told me he was trying to help in the only way he knew how.  But still.  It's not easy accepting what is basically charity from someone like him."

    alex "Thanks."

    "That's all I can get out.  I don't trust myself to say more."

    silver "Oh!  I just noticed the time.  I'm afraid that I'll have to ask you to leave.  I have a few things to take care of before an important meeting later on."

    alex "So, am I. . . supposed to come back, then?"

    silver "Oh, I'm so sorry, I'd forgotten to tell you-of course, I'd love to have you back, and I promise we'll cut to the interesting experiments next time, okay?"

    alex "Oh, good."

    "I try to subdue my relief.  I didn't want to come off as overly reliant on him."

    alex "So. . .if it's official then, is there anything I need to do?  Do you have a contract, maybe?"

    "He shakes his head, not at me, but at himself."

    silver " Please forgive how scatter-brained I am, it's been a long day."

    "An electronic panel appears before me, another long wall of text-at least it isn't numbers this time."

    silver "Sorry about all the legal jargon.  You would think we'd have contracts written in plain English before we built virtual fighting arenas, but I guess there isn't much to do about it.  I'm sure you'd like a few minutes to sift through it, but I can spell it out the essential terms for you if you'd like."

    alex "Thanks, but I, uh, have a lot of practice reading \"legal jargon\"."

    "He puts a hand to his chin and tilts his head a little."

    silver "Interesting.  Well, allow me to talk at you while you look through.  How about we meet every other day for now?  It will give me some time to work with the data in between and decide what we'll be doing."

    alex "Yeah, that sounds good to me."

    "My eyes widen a little as I caught sight of the figure he had planned for my salary.  It was a lot more generous than I was expecting."

    silver "What is it?  Does something not sit right with you?"

    alex "No, everything's fine."

    "Better than fine.  Part of me starts to think that maybe I should push for more-after all, I'd always been taught to never accept the first offer, especially if you have something to offer them that they would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else."

    "Nah, don't want to press my luck."

    "He watches me carefully as I finish going over the contract.  It seems fine to me-pretty simple, too.  It worried me that some things were a little open-ended-especially in terms of what we'd be doing, but I suppose even he wasn't entirely sure, yet."

    "It should be fine.  I go to the bottom of the contract and apply my signature to it.  The screen disappears.  Somehow, the mage had crept a few feet closer as I was signing, and was extending a hand toward me."

    "I shook it, seeing no real way to avoid that one."

    alex "Okay . . . see you in a couple days, I guess."

    silver "I'm looking forward to it.  Please wish your family well for me in the meantime."

    "I leave the building feeling strange and a little disoriented, like you do after wandering through a maze of funhouse mirrors.  I feel as though I'm starting to lose my animosity towards him is being blunted.  Was it possible that I would just drop everything so that we could be friends?  No.  No, I wouldn't let that happen. "

    "I'd spent too much time on this to not see it come to fruition.  I wouldn't forget."

    #TODO [scene change]"

    silver "Okay, let's put everything into it this time, and into the same object."

    alex "Geez, I know.  It's not like we haven't been at this for hours."

    "Silver Phoenix takes a wide-stance and stares at me from across the plain white space-a  supposed \"no distraction\" environment that would also promote relaxation of the mind.  Between us is a pile of random malformed objects, a bicycle, a piñata, an Atlas statue, and some that were just incomplete amorphous blobs . . . All the failed results of our \"experiment\""

    silver "Remember, we're broadening our horizons here.  Think creatively.  And remember to focus.  We need to be hitting the same point and thinking of the same thing.  The same, but different."

    alex "Ughhh, I don't get this.  How can it be both?"

    silver "We're working on creating the same object, but we both need to have our own creative impact on it.  There's no point in two of us creating an object together that we could easily create on our own, unless something unique is coming about as a result of it.  It's a collaboration to make one end-product with distinctive input from two imaginations."

    "Geez, this is going to be impossible."

    "I look at just how much \"progress\" we'd made in our research so far and kick at the ground, letting out a sign in frustration.  So much wasted effort.  And the only thing we had to show for it was a pile of useless junk."

    silver "Relax, we're working together, remember?  Never before has Virtuality supported the combining of imaginations into a single object."

    alex "I know.  You've been reminding me all day.  I just don't think it's possible."

    silver "I'm sure it is.  I spent months calibrating things in preparation for this.  And we've gotten close-we've at least seen the start of it."

    "He points to our most recent failure-a thick hardcover book, its cover blank.  Well, not completely.  There were two little splashes of color amidst the grey.  In the left corner was a little yellow dot.  That had been my part, but it was supposed to be a sunflower and not just a little speck.  In the center was a peach colored oval."

    alex "What was it you were trying to make?"

    "He frowns and bends down to pick up the book."

    silver "It was supposed to be your face."

    alex "My face?  That's kind of creepy. . .and isn't that complicated for what we're trying to do?"

    "He turns the book over and begins to examine the other sides."

    silver "Well it wasn't going to be a masterpiece or anything.  I figured it would be easier to focus on an image that was already in front of me."

    "He stops with the book's spine facing upward and grins.  He turns it toward me-an image of a blue eye stretched across the binding."

    silver "See, it isn't a total failure.  We must be displacing each other's influences somehow."

    "He plops himself down in the dust, still turning the book over for other clues."

    alex "I mean, what would it have looked like if it worked?"

    silver "I'm not entirely sure, but my hope is that both our elements would be incorporated in harmony with each other.  Perhaps you . . . I'm sorry, but what were you trying to make again?"

    alex "Sunflowers."

    silver "Oh, how cute."

    "He grins at me.  Oh geez.  My cheeks flush a little."

    silver "Well perhaps it would have been something like you in a field of sunflowers, at least for starters.  But think of what we could do once we get the simple things down.  This could be more than just an empty, stand-in book, it could be filled with the collaborative ideas of two people."

    "He starts to flip through the pages as if to emphasize his point.  After a few, his eyes widen and he smiles."

    silver "Oh, how interesting. . ."

    alex "What?  Is there something in there?"

    "I try to lean over and get a look, but he turns away from me."

    silver "Oh, so that's what you think of me?"

    alex "What?  No way. . ."

    "Had some of my own thoughts ended up somewhere?  What did it say?!  I start to imagine all the horrible possibilities.  I make a grab at the book, but he steps lithely out of the way with it.  In just a matter of moments we were playing a grade school game of \"keep away\"."

    silver "Oh, really?"

    "I make another lunge, but miscalculate the distance and caught a foot on the pile of our failures.  Oof.  I go tumbling.  Silver Phoenix gives me a look of pity from above and turns the book towards me."

    silver " Relax, I was just kidding.  Most of it's unintelligible-just a word or two here and there."

    "I get to my feet and swipe the book from him.  He was right-there wasn't a whole lot there, and nothing really notable. "

    silver "But it's fascinating, isn't it?  Neither of us were trying to put words inside the book, yet here they are."

    "He places a hand to his chin and furrows his eyebrows, contemplating this new turn of events."

    alex "So?  It was just an accident."

    silver "I think it proves that there's more to this than I initially thought.  Maybe. . ."

    "I shift my feet and sigh.  Does he always have to be so roundabout about saying things?"

    silver " Perhaps we shouldn't just be projecting our imaginations outward onto the object itself.  Maybe we need to be focusing inward onto each other as well.  Perhaps even more so.  Maybe that's what we need to truly collaborate.  Otherwise, the results will always be separated somehow."

    alex "So what does that even mean, \"focusing on each other\"?  How're we supposed to do that?  That's so abstract."

    silver "Yes. . .it is.  I think it may be better to just give it a shot than to try and explain it.  I'm not even sure I know what I'm talking about here.  This is all uncharted territory for me, too, remember."

    alex "If you say so. . ."

    "Geez, he was grasping at straws here.  Maybe he'd figure out soon that this just isn't gonna work."

    "We get ourselves into the \"ready\" position.  He makes us run through a few deep breathing exercises to focus our minds.  It's kind of cheesy meditational stuff.  I cringe as he starts going on in this monotone voice about \"reaching out to each other's mind\", but force myself to go along with it.  Y'know, for research purposes.  He continues."

    silver " Okay, get yourself ready.  Let's try something even simpler than before.  Let's create a painting on a canvas.  It'll be just like the book, but all we have to worry about is the image we'd like to create.  Let's work together here.  On three.  One. . ."

    "This whole thing felt a little goofy.  Reaching out to each other's mind-what was this?  Some sappy fantasy TV show?"

    silver "Two. . ."

    "Still, it would be cool to see it work.  To see both of our ideas blended so well together."

    silver "Three!"

    "I try to do as he wants.  I try to use my thoughts to \"reach out\" rather than just focusing on creating the new object.  It's strange, and I don't really know what I'm doing."

    "I feel nothing at first-what was I expecting?  This was crazy!"

    "A new feeling starts to take hold.  It was faint-so much so that I can't pinpoint just what it even feels like.  It's getting stronger... The edges of my vision take on this surreal light, and I feel a buzzing feeling in my head.  And –"

    "It's gone.  It all cuts off immediately; my vision fades to normal and my head stops buzzing.  Was I just imagining it-a product of a silly mind that thought that this might actually be possible?"

    "No, couldn't be.  What we have before us looks like a white lump of clay, spread out in a deformed, vaguely human shape.  Man, we couldn't even get the canvas part right?  There are a few splashes of yellow and brown paint on it, but nothing recognizable."

    "I look across from me to see a deep-set frown on the mage's face.  He closes his eyes and sighs, forcing a smile back on his face."

    alex "We're getting worse!  Maybe we should call it quits on this for now."

    "A look of surprise crosses his face, as though the idea was absolutely ludicrous."

    silver "Quit now?  Don't tell me you didn't feel that also?"

    alex "Well, I mean, I did feel something, but it's probably just my tired mind begging for a break.  I think I'm reaching my limits here.  I don't do this imagination stuff quite like you do, remember?   Maybe you should have a mage doing this with you."

    silver "Just a few more tries.  Please?"

    "I groan and roll my eyes at him.  Okay, maybe I'm not that tired, but I can only handle so much failure in a day.  Maybe Mr. Imagination is the one screwing us up here.  I feel I was doing pretty well, actually."

    silver "If nothing comes of it, we'll quit for today and have a nice afternoon tea before you go home, all right?"

    alex "Fine, but you can skip the tea, really."

    "He pouts a little, but pulls himself together, taking the 'ready' stance."

    alex "So what, same thing?"

    silver "Yes, no sense changing now.  We might have a better grasp of it this time."

    "He counts down once more after I take my stance.  We throw our effort into it.  That strange feeling begins to take hold, but even sharper this time.  It doesn't hurt, but it's uncomfortable-like someone probing around inside my head.  I feel a sudden probe that's stronger than before and my thoughts and body quickly withdraw in surprise.  We are left with something vaguely canvas shaped with a few haphazard lines of something that cannot be quite called paint."

    "Silver Phoenix looks upon me with concern, but with a hint of mild amusement peeking through."

    silver "Did we go too far?"

    alex "No, but. . . that was weird.  It just felt weird, and I wasn't expecting it."

    silver "See?  We're getting even closer.  That's a connection being forged between our thoughts that we're feeling, I'm certain of it.  We just need to stick it out the whole way and I think we'll have something."

    alex "Easy for you to say. . ."

    "I mutter it quietly and roll my eyes at him.  My head was starting to hurt a little now.  Almost like a migraine but not quite so sharp yet."

    silver "All right, just one more try, I promise.  Regardless of how close we get, we'll pack it in for the day."

    alex "Promise?  I'm pretty sure you've been telling me we'd wrap it up for awhile now."

    "He makes a \"cross my heart\" gesture that's apparently supposed to settle the matter.  I stretch my arms and return to the ready position once our newest failure is out of the way."

    "C'mon...this time.... I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to see it happen, even if I was skeptical."

    "3..."
    "2..."
    "1!"

    "I \"reach out\" to him-as silly as it sounded; I put all my effort into this and try to ignore the awkward buzzing going on in my chest and head.  At first I think that it is just going to fizzle out and die again.  It seems to, even."

    "But then there is a sensation, like a little hammer tapping at the inside of my head.  My thoughts go fuzzy; the way that you feel when you're just drifting off to sleep and you start to think nonsensical thoughts.  I have a brief, fleeting thought about a little white dog, but before I can parse it out, it's gone.  The edges of my vision fade, leaving this grey-white space.  What the hell?  I can barely see the mage from across the way, but he seems to be just as focused as I am."

    "A cup of tea sounds nice right about now.  Ooh, and those truffles I've been waiting to try... wait, what?  I don't even like tea that much."

    "And then suddenly, something breaks, and the entire area just disappears for a moment.  I hear a whooshing sound in my ears.  I raise a hand to hold my aching head and feel a cold bolt run through my body."

    "I'll need to remember to add some more  to the shopping list if I'm gonna pig out on them tonight.  And make sure they go to the right bakery this time; no more cheap, dry chocolate."

    "I touch something soft and warm.  In a daze I reach out and my fingers connect with a heated, slender face.  A feeling like firebolts shoots up my fingers upon contact and my vision goes funny."

    "I really wish he could see the potential in this like I do."

    "Next thing I know, it's my face I'm looking at.  I pull up a hand in surprise and find it not my own, but one much thinner; scrawnier, almost.  And then it all disappears.  My vision goes screwy once more."

    "One final, foreign thought runs through my mind:  Sick. . . of being alone."

    "Normality-or rather, what's normal for Virtuality-fades back in.  I see Silver Phoenix across the way, a hand resting on the side of his head, his eyes are wide as he stares at the ground."

    alex "Hey, what the hell just happened?"

    "I realize that I'm breathing heavily as though I'd just spent the past few minutes running.  He doesn't respond, but he is also breathing heavily. "

    alex "Hey-"

    "He snaps to attention and looks my way."

    silver "S-sorry.  That was an unexpected result."

    "Result.  I look around and see no canvas.  Guess we didn't get anywhere after all.  But still. . .that was weird.  Really weird.  Even he got a little freaked out by it.  I didn't really want to think about the implications of what just happened."

    alex "Guess it was a failure, huh?"

    "Let's never do that again. . ."

    "He shakes his head and seems to regain his usual composure."

    silver "No.  I don't think it was.  I think we were close.  I've never felt or experienced anything like that before, have you?  Not even in Virtuality have I experienced something so. . ."

    alex "Outright creepy?"

    silver " No, fascinating.  I genuinely felt a connection with you and your thoughts for a moment.  The only problem was that it still wasn't focused enough-it was too generalized.  Perhaps, if we-"

    alex "Wait, seriously?  You want to do that again?  Don't you think it was, I don't know, dangerous?"

    silver "Dangerous. . .?"

    "He closes his eyes and sighs."

    silver "Yes, I suppose I was getting a bit ahead of myself.  I need to think of the ramifications of this first.  This may sound a little crazy, but did you. . .?"

    alex "Did I what?"

    silver "No, never mind.  That's a discussion for another time."

    alex "I'm kind of bothered by all this.  I started thinking thoughts that weren't mine-but I couldn't even tell during it.  They felt like they were my thoughts at the time.  What if we get stuck that way?"

    silver "You're right, these are concerns we need to consider.  Until now, I'd never thought of anything but focusing our imaginations outward.  Now that we're directing it at each other, there's a risk our minds mingling-getting caught in each other."

    "He grows silent for a moment and looks almost downcast.  I guess the reality of it was taking a toll on his excitement.  But he brightens right up after a few seconds."

    silver "But if we can perfect it-if we're more careful from now on-perhaps this could go even further than just creating things together.  Perhaps this technology could be applied towards truly being able to connect with others.  Empathy to a new degree.  Imagine-we've never been able to truly know another person before.  There was always a wall.  But what if you could jump into the consciousness of that person, even for a few seconds!"

    alex "This is crazy!  We're not meant to do something like that.  It sounds unhealthy."

    silver "Why?"

    "He says this so sharply that I'm thrown off-guard a moment and can only blink stupidly at him."

    alex "It's just not right, I guess."

    silver "What's not right is to just shut the door on such a fantastic opportunity."

    "He starts to come to his senses again.  He stares at me for several seconds before dropping his gaze."

    silver "Look, we've stumbled upon this wonderful new thing today.  It would be a disservice to people everywhere if we simply left it here, to be buried by time.  I know that things are advancing quickly-and in such a strange way-but it would mean a great deal to me if you would see this through with me, now that we've started it.  Once we go through things together, we can work on adapting it for the general public."

    "Part of me wants to say no.  Hell, it knows I'm better off saying no.  But he was right in a way.  And those foreign thoughts from before kept running through my head.  They felt like mine at the time, but now I could parse it out that they definitely weren't.  Of course they weren't.  Did that mean that they were his?  Was that face I touched his?  Those hands?"

    "I was curious to experience it again.  What would happen?  It was scary to think of what could happen.  Maybe Virtuality would screw up my mind so much that I'd just become stuck as him mentally, forever.  What if we tried to leave Virtuality like that?  That was terrifying, yet not enough to deter my curiosity, amazingly."

    "I couldn't just make a snap decision on this, though.  As if still connected to my own thoughts, he looks at me earnestly and says:"

    silver "Hey, I think we both need some time to think on this.  I know I have a lot of thoughts to write down, and you need to decide if you want to do this again.   I'd need your full consent to continue this-the risks are pretty apparent, and I don't want you to take the decision lightly; not that you would, but. . .Well, you understand, I'm sure.  If you don't wish to continue, you needn't say anything-we'll find something more mild mannered from now on."

    "Our pile of failures fades away, leaving us back in his office environment.  He crosses the room to pat me on the shoulder and then takes a seat at his desk.  He seems to forget my presence almost immediately as he begins going over the data from our session on one panel, along with a second for recording new notes.  His fingers never stop moving as he rearranges things on the screen, highlighting things, adding annotations and marking points of interest, and other things I cannot even keep track of."

    "I start to warp myself back to my own office, still feeling rattled and uneasy, but before I've completely gone, he speaks in a quiet voice."

    silver "I would sincerely like to continue working on this with you, though."

    "And that was that.  I re-entered my personal quarters, mind raging-thankfully with my own thoughts this time.  What was I to do?"

    #TODO [scene change]"

    alex ". . .I mean, have you ever heard of something like that?"

    avatar "If you don't mind waiting a moment, I can search the databases for-"

    alex "No, no.  That isn't what I meant at all.  Can't you just shake your head and say \"Gee, no, I haven't,\"like a regular person."

    "She does this to the letter and I hold up my hands in quiet exasperation.  If she were a normal person, I would have thought she was mocking me."

    "We're in my office going over the events of the day.  There was just too much going on in my head to keep it to myself.  I needed to talk it over."

    alex "That isn't what I meant, either.  You were supposed to do that in the first place; it's too late now!"

    avatar "I'm sorry.  Would you like to send feedback to help improve the accuracy of my responses in the future?"

    alex "No, just-no."

    "I take a deep breath and pinch the bridge of my nose.  They did a pretty good job with these things-AI certainly was better than it was 10, or even 5 years ago.  . . .But it still wasn't perfect.  And a lot of times, the \"artificial\" part really shined through."

    alex "Look, can you just pretend you're a normal person for a little bit and just talk?  No offering to search databases, or send feedback, or monitoring my vitals, or anything else for a little bit."

    "Man, I must be lonely.  Didn't I have actual friends for this at one time or another?"

    avatar "If that's what you wish, sir.  Should I set a timer on this new behavior protocol?"

    alex "Aw, geez.  Just keep it on or whatever until I actually ask you for something.  And stop with the \"sir\".  We're friends, okay?"

    avatar "Okay, then.  What should we discuss now?"

    "She's trying to sound as casual as possible.  It doesn't really suit her and she isn't that great at it, either, but it's nice to know she's trying."

    alex "I'm just kind of worried, you know?  I've never felt something like that before.  I mean, I think I heard his thoughts somehow.  But it was more than just hearing them.  It was like they were my thoughts, too.  What if. . . what if he experienced the same thing.  What if he heard my thoughts too?"

    "Oh god, what could he have heard?"

    avatar "Speaking as your friend-"

    "She pauses with a cheesy wink."

    avatar "I think there are greater things to be concerned about than whether or not you shared personal information with him.  This is an extremely complex procedure without safety protocols yet."

    alex "That's the point.  It's something that's never been done before."

    avatar "But what if something serious were to go wrong and cause permanent damage.  Is the money truly worth the risk?"

    alex "Well the money really isn't for me, it's for my father, so yes, it is."

    avatar "I don't think either of your parents would appreciate the gesture if it came at the loss of their son.  Bills and bill collectors can be staved off in case of emergency, but there's no replacement for a human being. "

    "There is a distantly sad expression in her eyes as she says this.  Perhaps she's aware that as an AI program, she could never quite measure up to an actual human being.  Or maybe I'm just overcomplicating it – she's probably just turning on some extra emotion to add some weight to her words and sway me."

    alex "So what are you saying?  You think I should stop?"

    avatar "I'm saying that it is not in your best interest.  I can't tell you what to do, neither as your friend nor your assistant.  But as both, I wish you would not pursue this any further."

    alex "So if I quit, what am I supposed to do then?  I got into this whole mess because I had to.  I just don't really see any other way.   I don't want my mother to have to be harassed by bill collectors every day."

    avatar "You trust a little in your mother when she says that she can handle things.  Or we work hard to find another way, together.   Either way, Alex, this isn't worth losing you over.  The risk and the reward are too far apart."

    "I can't help but wonder if maybe she's right here.  What if something really does go wrong-something I can't come back from?  I get the feeling that the mage's love for his work is blinding him to the potential dangers."

    "But he isn't stupid either.  If the risk were really that high, he'd warn me or something, right?  He seems really professional."

    "I would have to decide right here and now if I was going to go on with it and commit to that decision. No more wavering back and forth on this.  Something still didn't sit right with me, but why change the plan now? "

    "Things might get a little weird, but I don't think I'm actually in danger.   Still, [avatar_name]'s giving me those puppy-dog eyes, like she's scared for me-or at least, she's pretty good at generating that emotion. "

    "But maybe I'm curious to see how things would go; curious enough to take a little bit of a risk. . ."

    "There's just no way I can quit now.  She'll just have to put up with it."

    alex "I'm sorry, [avatar_name], I really am, but I can't just quit.  I'll be careful, though, I promise."

    "She looks a little down at hearing this.  Gotta stay strong and go with my gut here."

    avatar "As you wish.  But I still hold out hope that you will change your mind before something bad happens."

    alex "Relax, I probably made it sound worse than it really is.  But, uh, would you mind keeping this between us?  I mean the project is supposed to be secret anyway, but if you answer any calls from my mom or anything, please don't bring it up.  Don't go calling her, either. "

    "She tilts her head innocently to the side."

    avatar "Why do you think I would do such a thing?"

    alex "Oh, uh, no reason."

    "I laugh a bit nervously-why am I nervous in front of an AI, anyway?  But I know if she had free reign she'd probably rat me out to my mother, hoping I'd listen to her at least when she called me in a panic."

    alex "Let's just leave it alone for now, okay?   I'm sick of thinking about it, let alone discussing it."

    avatar "Of course.  As you wish."

    "She starts to walk away in an attempt to give me some space."

    alex "Hey, wait."

    "She stops and I see her turn back a little.  Her expression is still a little sad.  But why bother if she didn't expect me to see it?"

    alex "You know your opinion does matter to me.  I just can't go with it this time, that's all."

    "I see her smile a little in the ghostly reflection."

    avatar "Of course.  I appreciate you telling me that."

    "She leaves me to myself."

    "I can't help but wonder what hidden depths lay in all that coding.  Or is it really just a bunch of numbers, symbols, and letters, and the \"depth\" all just projection on my part?"

    #TODO [Scene change]"

    silver "Hey, what's with you all of a sudden?  We were doing so well before."

    "He's right. We had started to get closer and little flecks of true cooperation through mental contact were beginning to shine through all the confusion and chaos.  So far, our best result was an unintentional parody of an old cliché: a fruit basket painting.  Except in our rendition, every piece was a bit misshapen and the colors were mismatched.  Some were even barely recognizable as fruit, or were a bizarre amalgam of several different types.  We had decided to continue trying to refine that idea."

    "It was definitely a bit of a high point for us, but I still felt apprehension bubble within me.  Every time we got closer to success, we also got closer to . . .having something weird happen again."

    alex "Why are you so sure it's my fault?   Maybe it's you."

    "I know that isn't true.  It really is all me.  I've been trying to redirect my thoughts in an effort to protect myself from sharing anything too personal with him if it happens again.  But all that seems to do is prevent us from succeeding in the first place."

    silver "No, I can feel it.  It's like calling someone and getting a busy signal.  You're distracted."

    "Ugh, he's not gonna give up for the day until we have a bit more success.  Maybe if I make sure to focus on both things equally, I can protect myself and we can still come up with something somewhat nice to look at.  Maybe not art-gallery worthy, but at least worthy of hanging up on the fridge.  I smile, remembering just how my mother used to love to pin up every little scribble I made on our refrigerator, right up until I left for college."

    silver "Please, try to focus."

    "He has another one of those wry grins on his face.  The kind that made me want to punch him out that night when Alyssa. . ."

    "No, I can't think about right now.  Gotta keep focused."

    alex "Yeah, yeah.  Shut up, I'm trying."

    silver "Ooh, that's no way to talk to your employer."

    "Of course, he's just joking.  I think he enjoys having someone around that bites back. "

    silver "All right, let's get serious, okay?"

    alex "Mmhmm."

    "He counts down, and I really do try this time-not because I stopped being afraid, but because I'm exhausted and want to go home.  Or at least collapse in one of his way-too-soft office chairs awhile.  Anything other than this."

    "I hear him say \"go\" and try to snap to attention."

    "But my focus is immediately broken as a new set of thoughts enter my mind."

    "Geez, what am I doing here?  Aren't we supposed to be enemies, or at the very least bitter rivals?  --Not bantering over tea and truffles."

    "Focus, idiot."

    "I shift my attention back.  Fruit.  Thinking of fruit, now.  Round, shapely fruit  (wow, that sounds creepy.)"

    "I can feel an intersection with Silver Phoenix's mental efforts, adding color the fruit and placing everything in a nice, round bowl."

    "Another thought pushes its way in as my vision started to grow white and unfocused-something not at all related to fruit."

    "It's a memory of the night he humiliated me, and my vow to surpass him.  He called me unremarkable that night-someone who couldn't be taken seriously.  And here I was working beside him, just scrambling to be his equal and work in tandem with him."

    "I can't stop letting myself despise him."

    "I realize too late that we've reached that point and I  immediately pull away before I get any of Silver Phoenix's thoughts, praying that stops him from receiving any of mine.  There's an uncomfortable feeling of \"disconnect\" as I pull away and my vision starts to return so that my mind feels grounded again."

    "Silver Phoenix is staring downward, deep lines of confusion crossing his face.  He looks up at me.  He opens his mouth, closes it, then opens it again.  He steps towards me."

    silver " Can I ask you something?"

    "Damn it, he saw something.  I feel my cheeks flush.  I just want to get out of there."

    alex "Look, whatever it is, it's personal and I don't want to talk about it."

    silver "I know, and I wouldn't ask normally, but-"

    alex "So then don't.  No \"but's\""

    silver "Why do you hate me?"

    "Again, I find myself stunned into silence."

    alex "I don't hate you, I just –"

    silver "Then why do you think you should hate me?"

    "I can see I've been cornered.  If I say anything, he won't let it go until I've spilled it all.  He's looking at me like an eager hyena waiting to lock its jaws around something juicy.  I don't see any other way I could get out of this one.  Maybe now's the time to put it all out into the open.  Everything."

    silver "Well?  Out with it so we can settle this and get back to work.  I'd like to put whatever it is behind us, if possible.  I can't imagine what I've done to offend you."

    "I sigh and try to find the best wording, but I'm having trouble finding a way to tell the story.  Every time I open my mouth with the intention of beginning, some impassable mental block comes down and stops me."

    "What's wrong with me?  I'd been waiting for this hadn't I?  Why am I trying to spare his feelings?  Or am I really that intimidated by him?"

    "I launch into a clumsy explanation of that night that ended up setting my life on an entirely different course.  About how I went from dedicated law student to Virtuality star, spurred by that one event.  I tell him about Alyssa-embarrassing as it was, now.  But really, I want to talk about how his insults and lack of regard for me that night cut me deeper than any weapon in Virtuality could.  I just skim over the rest for context."

    "The whole time he just stands there, eyes shut as though trying to recreate the night, nodding at appropriate intervals.  He grins a little when I mention Alyssa and her fan-girl behavior, but says nothing.  When I'm finished-ending with my decision to train hard and surpass him-he takes a quiet breath and opens his eyes.  I search for some glimmer of recognition in his eyes, to know that that night was significant enough to leave a lasting impression on him; but as always, his eyes are enigmatic and hold tight to their secrets."

    silver "Incredible. . .you've completely rearranged your life and spent the past several years putting all your efforts into trying to beat me, all because of some flippant comments I made to you?"

    "He starts pacing around, still talking, and gesturing with his hands as he speaks.  I get the feeling he's not so much talking to me anymore as he is to himself."

    silver "I was just a stranger to you.  A famous figure, perhaps, but not one that you idolized or anything.  Anyone else might have gone home, sulking with their tail between their legs, or spent the night fuming, yet you go through all this effort just to prove me wrong.  But it seems as though it isn't really to show me up-no, why not tell me straightaway who you were if that were the case-but that it's for yourself."

    alex "Look, I didn't tell you all this just to get a psychological profile."

    "He looks at me with a blank expression, then quickly snaps back to reality."

    silver "Of course, of course.  I'm sorry, it's just that I'm fascinated by this.  You're either incredibly stupid and your identity is too malleable, or you are just that determined. If it were the sake of love-to win the girl back and all that-I could understand it.  But she's out of the picture."

    alex "Look, I-"

    silver "You're much better off without her, anyway.  I can't say as I remember her, but I know the type and they're all alike.  Obsessive, and willing to throw themselves at whatever's \"hot\" at the moment. I'm betting that as soon as I stepped out of the spotlight they found someone new to adhere themselves to, and haven't looked back.  Hell, are you sure they're not a part of your fan club now? Such an empty girl, she's probably already forgotten your name."

    "I realize that he's starting to pace around me, growing a bit closer with each go around.  He holds a hand to his chin, index finger resting against his lips."

    silver "I suppose that's it, isn't it?  You really were forgettable, weren't you?"

    "Such a cruel statement caught me off-guard.   He circles closer, the tiger closing in on its prey.  He even has the presence of one.  Though we're pretty close in height, I'm beginning to feel somewhat small."

    alex "I don't care about being famous.  That's never mattered."

    silver "I'm not talking about being famous, I'm talking about being a unique individual-one truly worth knowing who can enrich the lives of those whom they know."

    alex "Are you trying to say that I wasn't worth knowing before?"

    "He sighs and looks wearied, holding a hand against his brow and looking up at me."

    silver "No, now listen to me.  Everyone is worth knowing-there is something to be learned from every person that exists.  But your limit lies far beyond where your initial goals would have taken you.  Even the highest career level you could aspire to wouldn't have pushed you as far as you've pushed yourself to get where you are now."

    alex "So what?  I would have been happy either way.  In fact, I probably would have had a bunch of real-world assets and maybe even a wife by now."

    "He stops right in front of me, looking me straight on with sharp, focused eyes."

    silver "Why do you concern yourself with the real world so much?   Isn't this real enough for you?  Isn't this just another facet of the real world?"

    "He places a hand on my shoulder, as though to prove to me the \"realness\" of it all.  Of course I \"feel\" it, or my brain thinks I do.  But what does that prove?  His expression is laden with some emotion, but I can't tell what it is.  Anger?  Disappointment?"

    alex " Look, I know all this is precious to you for some reason, but I just don't get it.  Virtuality does feel pretty real, but when it all comes down to it, it's just some game. "

    "What was I saying?  I knew I didn't really mean that, but come on- he was taking it too far here.  This just isn't the same as real life.  It can't be."

    silver "A game?  You think this is all a game?"

    "I feel the hand on my shoulder tighten and the mage pulls me closer.  I brace myself, expecting a quick sucker punch to the gut, but this is the opposite of what happens. "

    "Both his hands lock around my face as he pulls me in, and suddenly his lips are pressing against mine, my senses too overwhelmed and confused to even retaliate and pull back.  My body recognizes this sensation as a kiss and starts to react in the normal way almost automatically before my brain has a chance to catch up.  I catch a hint of something sweet, both in taste and in smell before my mind quickly recovers and interrupts-reminding me A:  that I am a heterosexual male, and B: that this man is my enemy.  I jerk back, almost falling, and wipe at my mouth.  My jaw opens and shuts stupidly as I struggle to find the right words, or any at all, for that matter."

    "He just stares at me with cold conviction, not looking hurt, or angry, or anything."

    silver "If this is just a game, as you say, then that was just a kiss; false, and therefore meaningless."

    alex " W. . .what the hell is wrong with you?  All that just to prove a point?"

    "He tips his head to the side, a curious cat-like glint in his eyes.  I feel my cheeks flush red.  I still can't believe it.  Did we seriously. . .?  Oh, god!"

    silver "Is that what you think?  Unlike you, I see the merit in the feelings we experience in Virtuality.  They're still real, even if the setting in which they're felt is not."

    alex " What are you talking about?  You aren't seriously trying to say that you . . .feel something . . . for me all of a sudden, do you?   C'mon, that's crazy.  And even if you did, you can't just do something like that."

    "He just raises his eyebrows with a neutral expression."

    alex "I don't get it.  Just. . . why?  I just told you how much I hated you."

    silver "Really?  Because what I got from your story is just what a magnificent, determined person you are, once you have the right \"spark\" to get you going.  As for your hatred of me, I don't think it exists anymore.  Even you say \"hated\"– in the past tense.  Even though you rebuke everything I ever say, you don't really mean it anymore, do you?  It's playful, if anything.  If you do have any hatred left for me, it's out of habit-because you think you should hate me."

    alex "Same thing.  I should hate you, therefore I do.  Stop trying to brainwash me into thinking otherwise, just because you feel something for me."

    "He pinches the bridge of his nose, the way he always does when he feels like I'm missing the point."

    silver "In any case, I think we're done here for the day.  Perhaps it would be best if we each left each other to our thoughts and regrouped at our next meeting."

    alex "What makes you so sure that I'll be back?"

    "This remark drew out a hurt expression from him, but only for a brief moment. "

    silver "Because while you feel certain in your feelings, I also feel certain in mine.  But of course, I suppose I would have no choice but to understand if you did not return. . ."

    silver ". . .Or, perhaps I'll come visit you for once."

    "He says this in a voice so quiet that I assume it wasn't meant for me to hear."

    "He doesn't give me a chance to respond to this, as I am promptly booted out of his Virtuality office, and sent back to my own, with a polite automated message informing me to this effect."

    "Geez, what a messed-up day."

    "I flop into my desk chair, reclining as far back as it would go and propping my feet up on the desk.  [avatar_name] shows up almost immediately, looking concerned.

    avatar "Understood.  Shall I prepare some coffee and perhaps some shortbread for you in the meantime?"

    "There's no such thing as \"preparation times\" in Virtuality, but I appreciate her trying to occupy herself so I can have some space."

    alex "Okay, but could you make it tea and some cookies, maybe?"

    avatar "Of course.  Any particular flavors, or shall I choose?"

    alex "You can go ahead and pick something."

    "She nods and leaves me be.  Tea?  I wonder.  Sweets?  Geez, maybe he really is having an influence on me.  I never used to drink tea, and sweets weren't really my thing.  In fact, I didn't really snack at all before him."

    "After him pushing his food on me with each visit, I eventually started giving in and letting him have that small victory.  We would snack and chat for about an hour each time.  I guess you could call it \"friendly\" but it doesn't change anything. . .right?  It certainly didn't call for this!"

    "I mean, where does he get off pushing all this off on me?  He has feelings for me all of a sudden? Or has this been going on for awhile and I didn't realize it?   I just don't get what it is that he's seeing in me."

    "So I'm determined-so what?  He's taking this way too far.  I'm not \"magnificent\" or anything.  It's his mind just romanticizing everything.  Maybe once he gets some time away from me, he'll realize that there was nothing special about the whole thing after all."

    "Honestly, he's more admirable than I am.  He really is trying to push limits with what Virtuality can do, to  extend the bounds of human experience.  How much more impressive can you get?  What's more. . .he's doing this not to gain some big-time recognition; if all he was after was recognition, he would have stayed right in the spotlight he already earned.  No, it's his own curiosity and drive to enrich the lives of others that fuels him."

    "How much more \"magnificent\" can you get?  And yet he's all tripped up over me.  I just don't get it.  He's put up with my asinine behavior this whole time with nothing less than a barrage of polite smiles and playful words.  But it's really more than just politeness at this point, isn't it?  He really finds something endearing about me, or at least he thinks he does. . .Him, with this brilliant intellect and ambition."

    "I shudder a little when I think of that quick moment of warm lips pressed against mine.  My brain hadn't been able to process it much at the time that it happened, but it was replaying it again and again in my thoughts now.   Every detail keeps coming back, even the ones that didn't register at the time.  One hand pressed against the back of my head, pulling me closer, the other resting on my cheek. Geez, why was I letting myself think about this?  I'm just not into guys, end of story."

    "But there was one more feeling that keeps coming up.  I didn't feel it at the time because it happened so fast, or at least I don't think I did, but whenever I replay the scene in my head, I feel this warm spark rise within me.  The thought isn't as repulsive as I feel it should be.  I almost feel that. . .NO.  No, no, no, no-no.  Not even gonna consider it."

    "That's strange, isn't it?  I'd never had thought like this about another guy in my life, but here I was deliberating over this.  Something felt different about him, though.  He was different from any other guy I'd gotten to know.  I couldn't place it-just something  felt \"different\".  I just knew that there was something about him.  Is it even possible to change your sexuality just for one person?"

    "God, this is crazy.  Why am I even considering it?"

    "I rub my temples and stare up at the ceiling.  Just what sort of conclusion was I reaching here?  That I was in love with him, too?  No, \"love\" wasn't an appropriate word for either of us.  \"Infatuation\" made more sense, but even that's a stretch. What was I even doing, thinking about this? Maybe this is just a phase.  An appreciation of each other's intellect, and nothing more.  Maybe all he wants is to see me act friendly towards him for once and we can move past this, and go back to whatever we were before. Or maybe the next time I see him, he'll realize just how overboard with the whole thing he went, and go back to thinking I'm just some idiot."

    "Yeah, sure.  Geez, I feel like I've gone insane.  Scratch that-maybe I have."

    "[avatar_name] returns with the requested tray of goodies.  She seems to understand that this is one thing I'm not really interested in talking over with her-at least not at the moment-and quickly disappears.  I immediately set into what she brought: some chamomile tea and a variety of cookies, all set out on a nice tin tray."

    "I realize, sadly, that I forgot to thank her.  Can something like her feel underappreciated, or just simulate it?  It seems that the lines between Virtuality and reality are growing ever more blurred.  My thoughts go back to how he spoke of it earlier.  To him, the experiences are genuine, even if the setting isn't.   But can an experience really be considered genuine if felt through false circumstances?  I see his point, but still can't help but feel differently.  For all I know, Virtuality could be messing with my head here; maybe I would never be having such feelings if we were in the real world."

    "I realize that I need something mindless to distract myself.  I go to start sifting through my messages, knowing most of it will be junk, anyway.  But of course, right at the top is a message from him.  It's just a handful of words tacked on before his flowery signature:  \"I'm sorry.  I hope we can continue our work together.\""

    "Geez, what happed to his usual rambling eloquence?  Was that seriously all he could muster?"

    "My first reaction is to type a scathing response as to why he has no right to ask that of me, but I stop myself.  What will that do?  I take a deep breath and write out one word in reply: \"Fine.\""

    "What would come next?  I wasn't sure if I wanted to know.  We'd be tiptoeing around each other for quite some time to come, but there's no way that this whole mess won't come up again."

    "Unfortunately, there wasn't anything left to do, but wait.  Wait, and try to get this strange day out of my head."

    #TODO [scene change – Choice 1, Scene 2]  *CON1.2"

    "\"Careful\".  That was the word of the day for the two of us.  Silver Phoenix didn't want to piss me off again, and I. . .well I didn't know what I wanted, but I definitely didn't want to give him the wrong idea. "

    "We sit in his cushy chairs with his usual tray of sweets and tea on the table between us.  He doesn't seem quick to get to work.  In fact, I'm almost certain he's stalling. We've been at this for an hour already-enough time for me to drastically slow on the amount of sweets I'm taking. "

    "It's not like I'm worried about gaining weight-I mean, this is just Virtuality after all.  But even if my stomach isn't physically filling up, my brain still knows how four cookies, an icing-lavished danish, and two cups of warm tea should feel and tells my stomach to give me a warning.  In other words, it's saying, \"no more, please\" in ways that are increasingly less polite."

    "The only reason why I'm still taking little mouse-like nibbles of cookies is to fill the uncomfortable silence between us while we both struggle to find a non-offensive topic.  Seriously, why does he insist on this?"

    silver "So how is your family doing, Alex?"

    "He asks the question very gently and takes a tiny sip of tea."

    alex "They're. . .all right, I think."

    "I realize I haven't kept in contact very well, despite doing this for them in the first place.  My mother's called several times recently, but always when I'm out, and I keep forgetting to return the call or it's just too late at night when I do remember.  What I never forget is to send a steady stream of funds over to her."

    silver "And your father?"

    alex "He's recovering, but he still has to check in with the doctors regularly.  Mom's still pretty worried about him, I think.   I don't think she'll ever be able to stop worrying about him now-we didn't really see this coming."

    silver "Not at all?"

    alex "No, I mean, he's a little heavy, but not fat.  And there's no family history of it either. "
    "I guess the smoking didn't help, but come on, a lot of people smoke and never end up in the hospital.  It's. . .just not something you think about unless it happens."

    silver "I suppose not."

    "He picks up a cookie and brings it to his mouth, but if he takes a bite, it's an impossibly tiny one.  When he sets it back down on a napkin beside him, it looks almost untouched."

    alex "So, uh, we gonna do some work today?"

    "I'm getting a bit sick of his stalling tactics, but still I try to keep a light tone with my inquiry. "

    silver "Yes."

    "He pauses to take another \"sip\" of tea."

    silver "Eventually, anyway.  What's all the rush about?"

    alex "No rush, it just seems a little silly for you to pay me to sit here drink tea with you."

    "This feels like a pretend tea-party –where all the drinks are just imaginary, so they can never technically be gone, so it never ends."

    silver "Good companionship is priceless, Alex.  I don't think it's silly at all."

    alex "If you say so.  I guess I shouldn't be complaining if I've got it this easy."

    silver "Indeed.  I think I could find a sitting companion for free if I wanted to."

    alex "Yeah, I guess so.  I don't think your fanbase has gotten any smaller since you quit.  I'm surprised they haven't figured out how to find you already."

    "I wriggle into the chair a bit further, since it didn't seem like we were going anywhere anytime soon.  \"Careful\", I remind myself.  I keep my body in a reserved position, arms and legs pulled back."

    alex "So why not pluck up one of your adoring fans for this instead of me?"

    silver "Because they're not who I want to talk to."

    "I choked a bit on the sip of tea I'd just taken.  Geez, why's he gotta say things like that?  He quickly corrects himself, though, seeming to recall our unspoken creed to be \"careful\"."

    silver "I mean, all they'll do is just sit here and gush.  Fun for them, but. . .well, not so much for me."

    alex "I suppose not.   I'm kind of surprised, though.  Usually you're pretty eager to get to work.  I thought we were kind of on the verge of a breakthrough last time, don't you?"

    silver "All the more reason to take it-er, the experiment, slow.  Don't you think?  I don't think we'll work well under the pressure of such expectations, don't you think?"

    alex " Maybe not, but that's never stopped us before."

    "I could see that it was more than just wanting to talk that was keeping him from wanting to work.  There was something else there-maybe fear.  Maybe he was afraid of what could happen this time.  What other private thoughts could be shared by that sudden spark of closeness?"

    silver "Don't worry yourself about it, Alex.  You're getting paid either way."

    "I sigh and slump in my chair a little.  I guess I wasn't really eager to get back to it either. Not after what happened last time."

    silver "Besides, you were the one who thought this was ridiculous and not worth the time."

    "I can tell that he senses the tension starting to rise again.  He's trying to change the subject."

    alex "I mean, it's cool, but I think that there's easier ways out there to improve Virtuality."

    silver "And is the easiest prize usually the one most worth it?"

    alex "Well, no, but I was just thinking that there are a lot of little improvements to be made that I think people would really appreciate."

    "He sits back and sighs, but doesn't look as disappointed in me as he normally would.  In fact, he smiles just a tiny bit-and not a smirk, either.   I think he's slowly growing fond of my ignorance towards his endeavors."

    silver "There are thousands of others capable of and perfectly willing to pursue those, and I'm sure that they will be attended to eventually, but there are very few who could see the full potential of what we're doing here; and despite your arguing to the contrary, I firmly believe that you are one of them."

    alex "Geez, man, I don't know.  I mean-"

    silver "Alex, have you ever taken a moment to ponder just how incredible the human mind is?"

    alex "What?"

    silver "Think about it-think about all the things that can happen just in your mind.  You can picture things without even seeing them; you can hear sounds, and even recall tastes and smells.  I mean, all that without actually experiencing these things.  You can even imagine entirely new things within it."

    alex "I guess that sounds pretty cool when you put it that way."

    silver "But now imagine that happening between two different people, but combined."

    alex "You've been preaching that to me this whole time, but I'm just not sure if I believe it."

    silver "Well, I suppose it's good for one of us to be a skeptic here.  I really don't mind it.  I think it grounds me a little.  Otherwise my head might be completely in the clouds-but it would still be nice if you could see things a bit more as I see them.  Perhaps you will when we succeed at what we're doing now."

    alex "Well, we never will succeed if we don't ever get to work again."

    silver "Have some patience.  Losing a day of work won't ruin things."

    alex "So you really don't intend to work today, do you?"

    silver "Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag,"

    "He says this with the most nonchalant expression, not the least bit disappointed by having his \"secret\" ousted."

    alex "Seriously?  This is kind of ridiculous, don't you think?"

    silver "I feel as though we're talking in circles.  Can't we tread some new ground?"

    alex "Yes, we can-if we go back to what I'm actually here for."

    "He just sort of scoffs at me in an irritatingly jovial way and hides behind his tea cup."

    alex "Don't tell me. . .you're actually afraid to."

    silver "Afraid?  What could I be afraid of?"

    alex "Oh come on, I'm sure there's got to be some embarrassing things about you that you'd rather I didn't know."

    "He looks down at the tea cup and saucer he holds in his lap with a half-smirk."

    silver "Fine."

    "He say this so quietly that I almost miss it."

    alex "What?"

    "He takes a deep breath and lifts his head, tipping it a little to the side like a puppy with piqued interest."

    silver "I have more stuffed animals on my bed than blankets, I sometimes sing to my plants instead of talking to them, when I was a child my imaginary friend was a fluorescent blue cottontail bunny named Gizmo, and I also get drawn into mindless reality TV shows every now and again even though they're clearly scripted and even with that the 'stories' are trite."

    alex "What-"

    silver "For seventeen years I used the word \"depraved\" instead of \"deprived\" because somehow I didn't know better, I like to take a nice long lavender bubble bath with candles and classical music in the evening to unwind,  and I once bit my dentist hard enough to draw blood because I forgot his finger was still in my mouth."

    alex "Okay, okay, I get it-you're not afraid to talk about embarrassing things; but you aren't fooling me."

    "I guess \"careful\" has been left behind in the dust.  He stops his barrage and crosses his arms with a thoughtful expression."

    alex "For everything you tell me, there's something more important to you that you're still covering up."

    "He seems to withdraw back into his chair just a little at this."

    silver "And just what is it that you think I could be hiding?"

    alex "I-I don't know.  That isn't fair."

    silver "It's perfectly fair.  If you can't even formally accuse me of something, then why should I tell you?"

    "It would seem from our words that we're back to our usual back-and-forth bickering, but there's something different about it this time.  It's almost playful.  It seems almost like he wants me to guess because he can't quite say it himself.  Meanwhile he just sits their smirking at me and raising his eyebrows. "

    alex "I don't see how you could have any bigger secrets. . . I mean, I already know how you feel about me, so that isn't it."

    silver "You're the only one here who insists that I'm keeping a secret in the first place."

    "Is it. . .is he afraid of me rejecting him or something?  No, I mean, we've been through all this already.  What's more to know?  But what if. . .what if he's been having some more. . .intimate thoughts about me?  My eyes widen a little subconsciously at the thought. "

    "But I really can't come to any conclusion from my own inner argument, and it's clear that he isn't spilling."

    "I throw my hands up in frustration.  I can't handle his coy attitude right now.  Why can't things ever be simple with him?"

    alex "Look, after the other day, I think I deserve a little more truth from you."

    silver "After the other day?  Perhaps things escalated a bit further than they should have, but I think you'll find that the other day I was being extremely truthful with you.  I put everything before you, and  you still have yet to really be truthful with me about it."

    alex "What do you mean?"

    silver "I mean that you ran away without ever responding."

    alex "I-I was shocked.  I needed some time to gather my thoughts.  I mean, that wasn't normal."

    silver "Oh, who cares about normal?"

    "He waves a hand as if to show just what he thought of \"normal\"."

    alex "This may come as a surprise, but not everyone does thinks like you do."

    silver "And what would you have preferred?  Months of coy courtship? "

    alex "I would have preferred nothing at all!  Did it ever occur to you that I wouldn't be interested?"

    silver "It did, and then I decided it was worth a try anyway."

    alex "Oh really?  So you just decided this for me?"

    silver "If I'm completely wrong, then tell me.  Tell me right now that I'm wrong."

    alex "Well, I-"

    silver "No.  No fumbling around.  No indecisive phrasing.  Just a simple 'yes' or 'no'.  Am. I. Wrong?"

    "I feel like I'm trapped.  I wish I could just say yes-that he's absolutely wrong.  But I know that I'm flip-flopping too much for that to be true."

    alex "I don't know."

    "He opens his mouth to rebuke me for not following instructions, but I butt in quicker."

    alex "I know that isn't what you wanted to hear, but that's all I've got.  I don't know."

    "For the first time since this whole mess started, I feel like I'm being truthful with myself instead of trying to polarize it towards one side or the other.  I just can't yet.  Not so soon.  I mean, this is all just crazy."

    "He seems to accept this, yet scoots his chair a little closer to mine."

    silver "That's. . .fair.  I didn't stop to think that this, well, wouldn't be easy, and my actions weren't exactly the gentle way to do things.  I suppose it's better than 'no'."

    "His chair has now been gracelessly relocated next to mine.  I worry that he's going to pull the same thing he did the other day, but he stays within his own space for now, leaning back in his chair with his chin tipped upwards."

    alex "So. . .what now?"

    "We both know that it's not work that I'm enquiring about this time."

    silver "I don't know.  I wish I did.  I'm not very good at this, I suppose."

    "He chuckles a little to himself and then looks over at me.  I find it a little embarrassing to be looking him in the eyes with him so close to me, and so I drop my gaze."

    silver "I guess somehow I thought that things would go smoothly on the first try.  I realize now just how ridiculous that was."

    alex "Yeah, kind of was."

    "I see his expression sour and I decide to back off a little.  For some reason seeing that little pout made me feel incredibly bad."

    alex "H-hey, I didn't mean it like that.  That was a pretty brave thing to do, though.  I mean, if it were me in your position, I don't think I would have had the guts to do. . . that."

    "I realize that we're both avoiding the word \"kiss\" as actively as possible."

    silver "I don't think I would have either, if it had even occurred to me that you might say no."

    "He still looks really upset.  As subtly as possible, and not quite understanding why, I place my hand on the arm rest between us, closing the frigid distance a little.  I guess I'm curious to see how he'll react."

    "He ignores my hand, though, and sits with his elbows resting on his knees, tea set aside."

    alex "Well, I mean, I haven't yet. . ."

    "Actually, he seems to be ignoring me all-together. "

    silver "I guess all those years of being surrounded by a constant crowd of people who would jump at any opportunity I gave them has ruined me a little.  Even if that wasn't really what I was interested in, it's just given me this sense of. . . power and importance that I did not have before."

    "He seems to have slipped into one of his monologues disguised as conversation.   Normally I would interrupt, but this time I am just content to listen.  I lean a little closer, though, a little disappointed that he has not noticed me."

    silver "I suppose it's good that you didn't immediately crumble to what I wanted.  Looking back, this is much better for me."

    alex "You're talking as though I made a conscious choice to reject you.  I was just doing what was best for me."

    "He chuckles at this."

    silver "I guess I'm still thinking in those self-important terms."

    "He sits back and looks me directly in the eyes. "

    silver "I'm sorry, I really am.  I can't believe I've made such a mess of this."

    "In one swift motion he places his hand over mine, showing that he really was aware of me the whole time-or at least making a convincing show at it."

    "He does not take his hand away, but he relaxes in his chair and turns his gaze away."

    alex "It's okay."

    "At least I think it is."

    "I am torn between an uncomfortable feeling that begs me to take my hand back and withdraw back into my comfort zone, and another feeling-one which likes the feel of his warm hand resting on top of mine, as though a protector."

    "I think he's steeling himself for the moment when I remove my hand, but I choose not to.  I let it stay there to see if the uncomfortable feeling will subside."

    "It doesn't really, but that's okay, too."

    ". . ."

    "We don't really have anything else to say after that.  It sounds strange to say that we just sat there like that for a good long while, each in our own thoughts, but that is exactly what happens.  My hand stays where it was, and so does his, and that is simply it.  Perhaps he leaned in a little closer when I wasn't looking, but if he did it was an almost imperceptible movement."

    "I still feel uncomfortable when I finally have to excuse myself for the evening.  That feeling didn't just go away.  I'm not okay with this just yet.  But I find that it doesn't bother me as much as I think  it should.  It feels . . . like a strange mixture of comfort and discomfort.  The two aren't flip-flopping, but instead co-exist in a paradoxical manner."

    "I slide my hand out from under his and get up, quietly saying goodbye.  I feel an odd expectation floating in the air, to not leave it as a simple \"goodbye\" -just spoken words."

    ". . . But I'm not ready for anything else yet.  That I sat here all this time is still a wonder to me."

    "His hand lightly brushes my arm as he says good-bye.  He seems more hopeful now than he did before.  But neither of us really know what to say anymore, so I quickly exit before it gets awkward.  Or more awkward than it has been already."

    "I'm glad to see my own office in front of me again.  I collapse on the couch instead of my office chair.  We didn't do any work, but I feel exhausted.  It's mostly emotional, I guess."

    "I brace myself for [avatar_name] to come in and try offering refreshments.  No, please, no more!"

    ". . .But I quickly tumble into a tumultuous doze before she enters the room.  Somewhere in the fog of half-sleep I hear a call coming through, but my head isn't clear enough to understand what it is beyond being familiar.  It stops after a few minutes, leaving me in peace."

    "Sleep comes down on me like a heavy curtain, and all the worries and confusion of the day is far removed for at least a little while."

    #TODO [scene change]"

label lbl_CON2:
    #TODO [CHOICE 2-ALYSSA] *CON2.1"

    "I launch into a clumsy explanation of that night that ended up setting my life on an entirely different course.  About how I went from dedicated law student to Virtuality star, spurred by that one event.  I tell him about Alyssa-embarrassing as it was, now, and how that one stupid kiss made a mess of everything; about how I could just feel the anger and the hatred well within me when I saw him do that.   I look him in the eyes as I do so, trying to communicate as best I can what a significant point in my life if was for me.  What was an apparently forgettable night for him was a tremendous turning point for me."

    "All the while, I search his face for some sign that my words are conjuring up some memory for him.  But if this is true, he certainly gives no indication of the fact.  He stares back, his eyebrows locked in a concerned expression and his jaw set firm.  He does not interrupt once."

    "I feel my face grow more and more heated as I speak.  It feels like I've been running my mouth about this for hours, but really it's only been a few minutes.  My storytelling is scattered and disorganized as I try to fit in all the facts.  As I speak, I wonder why I'm even bothering to tell him.  What will this even change?   I hate that I cannot read his expression, but something tells me he's compiling a mental list of all the stupid things I've done."

    "After I've finished, he just sort of closes his eyes and delicately cups his chin between his thumb and index finger.  I wait for a moment, but after nearly a minute passes and he still has said nothing, I grow impatient."

    alex ". . .So?  Don't you have anything to say?"

    silver "Forgive me if it takes a moment to compose the words."

    "he says pinching the bridge of his nose with some annoyance.  He takes a deep breath and reopens his eyes to look at me."

    silver "I really don't understand you or your actions, Alex.  I've tried, and perhaps with some great span of time I could gain some sort of adequate understanding, but truly you baffle me.  You're intelligent enough to recognize that this girl of yours- Alaina, was it?"

    alex "Alyssa."

    silver "Alyssa-is not worth your time.   She kept you company once and gave you companionship, but you know that you're better off without her.  Is that true?"

    "I shrug."

    alex "Yeah, I guess it is.  I mean, I definitely don't feel like I ever loved her."

    "He nods, affirming that this was the answer he expected."

    silver "So I don't get it.  She didn't mean anything to you.  I certainly didn't mean anything to you.  Why go to all this trouble?"

    alex "I don't know, I just-"

    silver "Are you stupid?"

    "I stop, mouth agape almost comically."

    alex ". . . What?"

    "Did he seriously just say that?"

    silver "I mean, seriously, had you ever considered what would come next after you'd gotten your \"revenge\"?  This is the most ill-thought out plan I've ever seen!  Uprooting your whole life plans for. . . Whatever this is."

    alex "Well of course it's going to sound stupid when you simplify it like that."

    "He turns to me, an almost mischievous glint in his eyes as he steps closer.  If he were a cat, his tail would be twitching and his ears tipped forward with extreme curiosity."

    silver "Or maybe. . .maybe you aren't stupid, but jealous."

    "He swiftly shushes me before I can ask him just what he's going on about now."

    silver "Jealous of all that attention your girlfriend got.  Jealous of that one little kiss.  Well that's easily remedied, isn't it? "

    "Before I can understand what's happening, he places one hand behind my head while the other lightly holds my chin.  He pulls me forward until our lips are pressed together in what my overloaded mind recognizes as a kiss.  It all happens so quickly, that my body reacts to this action the way it is accustomed to.  I feel myself start to lean into it, but then it hits me like a cinderblock dropped from a third story window directly above.  God, what am I doing?  No, what is he doing?"

    "I jerk back, another automatic reaction.  I wipe at my mouth and stare at him with what I imagine is a bewildered expression.  Or whatever is beyond bewildered.  Shocked, stunned, completely flipping out."

    alex "What the hell was that about?  I-I. . ."

    "Geez, just what the hell?  I mean, what even am I supposed to say?  I can't even gather my thoughts."

    "He doesn't answer, only stares back.  What was that expression on his face?  It wasn't hurt.   No, now he looks like the cat that just caught the bird it was stalking all morning.  He's grinning, the corners of his eyes pulled upward in his usual smarmy way."

    alex "You've taken it too far this time.  You can't just screw with peoples' heads like this."

    silver "Really?  That's what you think I'm doing here?"

    "He shrugs, a strange look that I cannot quite read crossing his face, but it's quickly replaced by another grin."

    alex "Can't you take anything seriously?  Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not gonna hang off your arm like all those other girls you fool around with."

    "He gives me a sardonic look as if to say, \"really?\""

    silver "Well fine, think what you want about me.  I can't change your stubborn mind anyway."

    alex " Seems like we're done for the day,"

    "I say, bringing our conversation to an abrupt end.  Regardless if we were actually done or not, I don't wait for reply before removing myself from his office.  I'm not getting mixed up in his games."

    "The familiar sight of my own office surrounds me, and I immediately plop down on my sofa, folding my arms up across my face, as though that will shield me from all the ugliness of the day.  I realize too late that I should have covered my ears instead, as not a minute later, I hear a \"new message\" notification from the system."
    
    "Can't he just leave me alone?  I don't want to deal with this right now!"

    "I've earned enough money from him that I have a decent head start on Dad's medical bills.  I could probably find something else. . ."

    "I almost have myself convinced that I should send in my resignation, when [avatar_name] meekly makes her appearance in the room.  She bends over, lightly touching my arm with a look of concern on her face."

    avatar "Sir, I know you don't like it when I pry, but just a few minutes ago I noticed sudden upswings in your blood pressure and heart rate."

    alex "Well, as you can see, I'm okay."

    avatar "Yes, I suppose so."

    "She removes her hand, and stands back a little, both hands clasped together in her lap."

    avatar "Do you wish to talk about it?"

    alex "No."

    "Her look of concern deepens.  I sigh.  Nothing like an AI giving you a guilt trip."

    alex "Look, maybe later, okay?  I just need to have some time to think, first."

    "She brightens up considerably at this and immediately offers to fetch some refreshments, which doesn't sound like such a bad idea right then."

    avatar "Your usual coffee and perhaps some shortbread?"

    alex "Actually, could I have some tea and cookies today?"

    "I cringe a little after saying this.  I realize that these are just the sort of refreshments that he's always pushing on me.  God, am I really letting him grow on me like this?  I don't take back my request, though.  As much as I hate to admit, it really is what I want."

    "[avatar_name] nods dutifully, though looking slightly amused.  She asks if I would like any particular flavors, to which I ask her to just surprise me.  I don't have the energy to even consider such a simple question right now."

    "She leaves me in peace for a while before bringing everything out.  Of course, there's no such thing as \"preparation times\" in Virtuality, so it's all done for my own sake."

    "With her gone, there is perfect silence in my office.  Normally, I would quite enjoy it, but now it feels cold and harsh.  I could change this easily, but don't for some reason.  God, he really is screwing with my head."

    "Of course, that message is still there, awaiting my decision as to its fate.  Would it hurt to look?  Just to take a peek at the subject line, or something?"

    "Ugh, why am I even considering this?  After the stunt he pulled this afternoon, he's not worth my attention."

    "I  make the snap decision to delete it.  Blip.  It's gone."

    "I start to wonder \"what now?\" but then I realize that I don't really care.  Not at this moment, anyway.  I'm still pissed about the whole thing.  I consider doing some sparring to let off steam, but then [avatar_name] chooses this moment to re-enter with the sweets.  She sets them gently before me and quickly excuses herself.  I snap to attention as soon as she enters.  For some reason I feel embarrassed looking like a disoriented mess in front of her, just as I would before an actual person."

    "I thank her and go back to my absent-minded wall staring.  I'm not ready to think about what comes next."

    "I sigh and lean back, stretching my arms high above my head.  I shudder to realize that I still remember how his lips felt when pressed against mine.  Ugh.  I cringe as the memory replays as though on repeat in my head."
    "  "
    "Just what the hell was he thinking by doing that?  I mean, why?  . . . Just, why?  And why can't I quit thinking about it?"

    #TODO [scene change-Choice 2, Scene 2] *CON2.2"

    "Someone's knocking on the door.  No. . .it's my desk.  Someone just rapped on the edge of my desk.  I pull my head up, a feat that required an almost gargantuan effort.  My eyes were still blurry-after all, I'd been conked out for at least a couple hours.  I'd only meant to rest my eyes for a few minutes. "

    "Standing to the left of me, staring down was that smug bastard. "

    silver "Working hard, I see?"

    alex "How did you--?"

    silver "It doesn't really matter."

    "He waves the question away. "

    "I just thought I would pop in and we could finally talk, seeing as you've taken to ignoring every message I've sent you the past couple of days."

    alex "Oh, I haven't just ignored them.  I deleted 'em all without a second thought."

    "He sighs as he falls back into a casual pose on my sofa."

    silver " You're still mad."

    alex "Fuming, actually."

    "He leans forward and steeples his fingers."

    silver "Well if you had read any of my messages, you would have seen that I apologized for everything more than once."

    "He sounds more than a little tense."

    silver "Are you aware that we had an appointment yesterday?"

    alex "Of course I am.  Unlike you, I take my engagements with others seriously."

    "He winces a little, but otherwise ignores the dig at him."

    silver "Not seriously enough to show up or check your messages."

    "Geez, way to make me sound like a hypocrite."

    alex "I'm still more than a little pissed, and I intend to continue being that way."

    silver "Listen, as \"fun\" as this is, I didn't come here to trade jabs with you all day.  Since you were uninterested in all my electronic apologies, I've come to do so in person."

    "I just raise my eyebrows in the most derisive way I could muster and swivel lackadaisically in my chair.  Maybe it was childish, but it's not like I was going to make this easy for him."

    "He pushes back his hair uneasily."

    silver "Well I had a much more eloquent apology in my emails, but it all comes down to \"I'm sorry,\" anyway, so I suppose we can do away with the fancy words."

    alex "Seriously?  That's all you've got?"

    silver "I wasn't finished.  I just, well, like I said, I apologize for pushing all that on you at once, Alex.  I realize now what an overwhelming thing that was.  I mean, for me to-"

    alex "Overwhelming?   You're really missing the point, here.  I already told you, I'm not gonna fall for your \"pretty-boy\" act the same as everyone else.  I don't know what it is you want from me, but you aren't getting it."

    "He looks a little shocked, as though this hadn't really occurred to him. "

    silver "Just what do you mean by that?"

    alex "What I mean, is that I've never seen you with the same girl twice.  Or the same anybody twice.  Friends, girlfriends-it doesn't seem to matter; you seem to change up your crowd on a daily basis.  I mean, do you take anyone seriously, or are we all just playthings to you?  I'm not another one of your fan girls, you know, so you can stop thinking I'm gonna fawn all over you."

    silver "You sure have kept a watchful eye on me over the years, haven't you?"

    "My face reddens a little at this accusation."

    alex "T-that's not the point!"

    silver "Why do you insist upon this characterization of me, when in reality it's quite the opposite?  They all left me when they realized that I refused to be their vehicle into the spotlight.  What they wanted from me was not companionship, but to be a stepping stone into the world they pined for.   They enjoyed the parties and the hype, not me."

    alex "You expect me to believe that all you want is \"companionship?\""

    "Wait, why do I even care about this?  None of this matters to me, but I know that I have a good point here, so I'm not letting it go."

    silver "Yes!  Is that so difficult to believe that I'm not this shallow person you believe me to be?"

    alex "I really doubt all those people just walked away from you, even if they weren't getting exactly what they wanted.  They all seemed to get quite a bit of attention, anyway-at least more than they would on their own.  I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to say that they spent their evening in your private quarters?"

    silver "Fine, perhaps I pushed them out, but is it really not justified?   Should I have let myself be chewed away at by all their piranha-like appetites for fame and excitement?  All for something so empty and unfulfilling?  Should I have followed your example with this empty-headed girlfriend of yours that you didn't truly love but kept around anyway?"

    alex "Alyssa has nothing to do with this."

    silver "You're wrong.  Because she's just one of the many that I've tried seeking a night of meaningful camaraderie from, only to find an uninteresting and empty-headed person instead."

    alex "Oh come on, it's not like you even really remember her!"

    silver "I don't need to.  I know the type."

    alex "Geez, you can't just regard other people like that.  Just because they aren't up to your standards, doesn't mean they're \"empty\" people.  That doesn't mean you should just get rid of them and trade them in for new ones.  I mean, wasn't I just one of those empty people to you once, too?  You dismissed me before you even knew who I was, yet now you suddenly care.  You didn't even remember that we'd met before!"

    "I realize I'm near shouting, and I expect a look of offence upon his face.  Instead, I see a sly grin, as though he just came onto some interesting tidbit of information."

    silver "So that's what's bothering you about this, is it?"

    alex "W-what?"

    silver "This was never about me kissing your girlfriend-truth is, you probably didn't care about her, either.  Not much, anyway.  It's intriguing that what you're really upset about is that I didn't acknowledge you."

    alex "You did more than that-you told me in front of everyone that I was forgettable-nobody.  How come you didn't have the nerve to call all them out, when you thought the same thing of them, huh?!"
    silver "So am I to assume that you have no real objection to what I said to you?"

    alex "Of course I do!  I was getting there!"

    silver "Calm down, no need to shout."

    "Naturally, being told to calm down had exactly the opposite effect. I could only feel my blood boil hotter."

    silver "Look I can't really speak for myself on that night, because as you already know, I don't remember a thing about it.  But if that's what I did to you, then I apologize.  But surely you haven't come all this way, pursued me for so long, just to prove me wrong, have you?"

    "I let out a frustrated puff of air as I realize that I have no good answer to that question.  I didn't want to admit that he was right. Not out loud, anyway."

    alex "That isn't what matters!  I'm here to tell you that you really were wrong.  What I've gone through to get here isn't important."

    silver ". . . I see. . ."

    "He shrugs, unconvinced."

    "I can see he's struggling to hold back a chuckle as he reads my face.  I can practically see his ego inflating."

    alex "This isn't funny!  And it isn't all about you, either."

    silver "I know that, Alex, but have you ever just taken a step back from this situation and really, truly, thought about it?"

    alex "What do you mean?"

    silver "You weren't a fan of Virtuality before our first encounter, and I'd imagine that certainly didn't make you a fan afterward.  Yet, you decided to devote your adult life to becoming proficient in the fighting arenas.  Why?  Just so that you could one day prove that you were better than me.  That you were memorable and worth knowing."

    alex "So what?"

    silver "So what?  Any normal person would have just walked away from it all, probably gone home, trashed me on some internet forums, and returned to their normal life.  Hell, they probably would have done everything they could to avoid me in the future.  But you go to all this trouble.  Just what was your end goal?  Just what did you expect to happen after you succeeded?"

    alex "I don't know!  I just knew that it was something I needed to do, and that's it."

    "He places a finger to his chin and thinks for a moment."

    silver "That's. . .admirable, I suppose-at least in a bull-headed sort of way.  But really, just how do you \"win\" this game of yours?  I told you I don't fight anymore, so if your objective is to beat me in a fight, you're out of luck."

    alex "No, that's not-I don't really know what I'm after anymore, okay?"

    silver "If it makes you feel better, I readily admit that I was wrong about you that night.  Or at least, I'm wrong about you now, because back then you certainly were a faceless little whelp, or at least you must have been seeing as I don't recall a thing about you."

    alex "Hey!"

    silver "Sorry, sorry.  What I mean to say, is, if you're still seeking my approval, you already have it.  So can we call off this grudge of yours?"

    "I feel my whole body tense up with frustration."

    alex "You just don't get it.  I don't think you even can get it."

    silver "Do you, really?"

    "I took a deep breath to resist the urge to punch him for his constant questioning.  And as I did so, I realized that I had to be truthful with myself:  No, I really didn't know what I was after anymore.  I'm not sure I really was after anything."

    alex "Maybe I don't understand it anymore either, but I know I'm not satisfied yet.  And I know I'm not ready to just give up on everything and call you my friend, especially after what you did the last time."

    "I realize that we've gotten a little far from the point. God, why do I let him derail things like this?"

    alex "Look, all that matters is that you've way overstepped your boundaries with me, both as an employer and an acquaintance."

    silver "I've been demoted to mere acquaintance?"

    alex "Would you just shut up for one moment and let me speak?"

    "He gives me a wounded puppy dog look, but nevertheless does not try and press his luck with me by speaking."

    alex "As I was saying, this isn't about what happened years ago.  This is about what happened in the present.  What you did recently.  You can try and make it more complicated, but when it comes right down to it, you screwed up.  Do you get that?  You crossed a line that you shouldn't have.  That's what I'm pissed at you about, and that's what you need to be feeling sorry for right now."

    "He glances downward, actually looking apologetic, to my surprise.  Or, if he was faking it, he was doing a damn good job.  He nods to himself and closes his eyes briefly before meeting my gaze to make sure I had said my piece."

    silver "I regret ruining everything then, because I truly think that you were close to considering me a friend before that."

    alex "Oh, please, don't flatter yourself."

    "This seems to wound him; he winces as if in pain, but continues."

    silver "Well, whatever you may think of me, and whatever this is truly about, my purpose for coming here still remains the same-I'm here to ask that you come back to working with me.  I'll make sure not to upset you again, and we can return to a normal, working relationship.  You can go back to pursuing whatever motives you had, and I can advance in my research with my preferred work partner.  Everyone wins."

    "I think it over for a minute.  Do I really want to get back into this?  I know he will probably only be on his best behavior for so long.  But any other alternative is less than ideal at this point.  Reluctantly, I come to the conclusion that staying with him is probably for the best."

    "He looks up at me expectantly as I mull it over, but doesn't beg. "

    alex "Fine."

    "I say this while trying not to sound too \"fine\" with it at all."

    alex "But, seriously, if things get weird, I'm out.  That's it."

    silver "I understand.  I'll treat it as though I'm on \"probation\", as it were."

    "He stands, preparing to excuse himself from the room, but not before standing there a moment with his arms outstretched in an awkward request for reconciliatory hug.  When it became clear that I wasn't biting, he drops his arms to his sides and swiftly pats me on the back as he turns to go.  I'm about to rebuke him for crossing the line so quickly, but I decide to hold this one back."

    silver "Good to have you back.  We'll resume with our next scheduled meeting."

    "And then he's gone, leaving me to a tidal wave of thoughts.  I don't really know how to feel about him anymore.  It's like I want to feel every emotion at once, and so it all ends up rolled into one giant ball of confusion.  I mean, I have a right to be mad, here, but everything's so jumbled up that I'm not sure what I was mad about in the first place."

    "I mean, it should have gone without saying that the last thing I wanted was a kiss from him.  These lips have always been strictly meant for women, and that's it.  I'd never had any doubts about that.  And that's exactly why a shudder rippled through my body every time it runs through my mind what happened."

    "But it was more than that.  I mean, it was just plain offensive to think that he was trying to treat me like another one of his single-night girls.  Woo and then disappear.  It felt like an insult to my intelligence, even if I was far from interested in that sort of thing."

    "Yet here he was, claiming that I've got it all wrong, that that's not the game he's playing.  Not only that, but that he's never been after that sort of thing.  \"Camaraderie\" what kind of bull is that?"

    "Who goes into something just looking for friendship and love?  Everyone's after something, even if they don't want to admit it.  At least that's how my relationship with Alyssa ended up . . . some might say I'm just being cynical, though."

    "I lean forward and place my elbows on my desk, resting my head in my hands.  Maybe I'm just a cynic."

    "But really, what am I getting myself into, here, going back into this mess?"

    #TODO [scene change – to CON1.3]"

    silver "Mmmm, what's on your mind?"

    "He leans on the table between us, looking up at me with those pleading puppy dog eyes."

    alex "I don't know, I don't really have any well-formulated thoughts right now.  Only words."

    silver "Tell me the words, then."

    "He reaches out to pat me lightly on the head.  He's been constantly making these affectionate gestures.  I never really gave him the okay to, but I guess not admonishing him for them has been pretty much all the okay he needed.  And it does feel a little comforting, I guess, even if it still is extraordinarily weird still.  Alyssa used to do the same sort of things, always trying to be cutesy."

    alex "The words don't really make much sense either."

    silver "Well anything is better than silence.  You haven't been right all day.  That's why we're taking this break right now, aren't we?  We can't progress with our work until you get your focus back.  Right now you're just shutting me out."

    "He makes a small pouty face that even I have to admit is kind of adorable.  We were actually trying to make some progress on the experiment today, but our results were nowhere near where they had been before."

    alex "I just. . . things just feel wrong still."

    silver "What things?"

    "He asks this so innocently, yet I know he knows perfectly well what 'things' I'm talking about."

    alex "You know, you. . . me. . .whatever sort of relationship exists between us now.  I don't even know what's going on here.  What even is this?"

    silver "What do you mean by that?  You told me that there was nothing between us.  You agreed to come back and put up with me, but you also made it clear that you weren't interested.  We're employer and employee now, or at least that was my understanding of it.  Am I wrong?"

    alex "It just feels. . .wrong, still, I guess."

    "I know he's just fishing for me to tell him what he wants to hear.  He takes it a step further by swiftly moving to a chair next to mine and placing a hand on my arm.  I can tell he's expecting me to tell him to knock it off, but once again, I just don't feel like I want to.  How quickly he drops the façade of pure innocence in our relationship.  Employer-employee, my ass."

    silver "Does it feel wrong because it is truly wrong, or because you're still telling yourself that it should be?"

    alex "I-I don't know."

    "He places his hands on the arm of the chair between us and leans towards me, putting his face just an inch or two from mine.  I can practically see him calculating the chances that I'll storm out and never return if he tries to kiss me again.  He seems to come to the conclusion that the odds aren't in his favor and only hovers there."

    alex "I mean, it's weird right?"

    silver "I don't think so."

    alex "I've only ever had girlfriends before-I've only ever been interested in girls before.  And now you want me to just suddenly start falling for you, just because you start having feelings for me."

    silver "I don't expect anything from you except for your brilliant input in our work."

    "He says this with such a smarmy grin that I don't even think he believes what he's saying."

    alex "C'mon, be serious with me for a minute.  I know that's not all you're after."

    "He removes his hand with a great sigh and sits back, rolling his eyes and placing his hand against his forehead in frustration."

    silver "Alex.  Just what do you want me to tell you?  I can't resolve things for you.  I can only tell you what I think, and you've been acting as though my opinion is nothing but problematic for you."

    alex "Well, it kind of is.  I never would have felt so conflicted, if it weren't for what you did."

    silver "Perhaps the only way to settle it is to actually nurse both sides of this conflict."

    alex "What do you mean?"

    "But as I ask this, I have a funny feeling that I know full well what he means."

    silver "You've been going on as though you definitely don't agree with any of these feelings.  But why not seriously entertain the idea of you agreeing with these feelings.  I don't mean just picturing it for a moment, either.  I mean genuinely going along with It for awhile."

    alex "Yeah, I'm sure you would like it if I did that, wouldn't you?"

    silver "I wish you would get rid of the notion that I'm out to manipulate you, here.  I genuinely care for you, Alex, and that's why I very much dislike to see you struggling.  And to be honest, this constant tug-of-war with my own feelings is getting tiresome, too.  Sooner or later you need to decide for yourself so both of us can feel some relief."

    alex "That's a nice thought, but I just can't."

    "He leans in closer again, this time putting a hand on either side of my face.  I flinch a little, but I don't move away."

    silver "Close your eyes, Alex."

    "With him so close, I'm locked into the intensity of his gaze.  It's what I imagine staring down a dragon would feel like."

    alex "W-why should I do that?"

    silver "Just do as I say, please."

    "I continue to make a series of confused and pleading expressions at him, and finally he lets go of me and sighs again in aggravation.  I'm surprised that I feel a bit miffed that he backed off so easily.  But really, could I have just gone along with what he wanted?"

    silver "I'm not going to make you, you know."

    "He says this as though he has read my thoughts."

    silver "Like I said before, this is all your decision.  I can lead you there, entice you to see things as I see them, but I'm not going to force my ideals upon you like I did before.  The last thing I want is to make you walk away from me again."

    "I wonder if he knows that him pulling away from me like that felt like such a tease.  But I could never. . ."

    "No, definitely not.  No, no, no.  I'm not falling for his tricks."

    alex "I'm sorry."

    "This is all I manage to say.  I look away, feeling embarrassed for some reason.  There is an electric charge to the air right now.  Part of me wants him to try it again, but I know it would have the same results.  My mind just won't let me go along with it.  To actually consent and acknowledge that this is happening and is something that I desire."

    silver "Don't apologize.  Never apologize for your own feelings.  Not to me, or to anyone else.  You have a right to them just as I have a right to my own.  To be honest, I know that I am asking a tremendous thing from you.  So really, I should be the one apologizing. "

    "He stands and ruffles my hair a little with his hand."

    silver "Come on.  I think we've taken a long enough break.  Why don't we try a little bit more before we call it quits for the day?"

    alex "Do you really think that anything'll come of it?  I mean, we were doing pretty bad earlier. . ."

    silver "It's better than just sitting here agonizing over these things."

    "He offers me a hand up.  I have a feeling that he's trying to lead me towards the conclusion he wants with little baby steps like these.  And I feel that it's working.  A warm feeling runs through me when I take it and I feel his fingers wrap around my wrist as he pulls me up.  I'm used to his little touches by now, but there's something different about this one."

    "Once I'm on my feet, his fingers release only slowly.  I can tell he doesn't want to let go, but he probably feels that I would object if he tried to lead me by hand to our practice set-up.  But at this point, I'm not so sure that I would."

    "But then again, I'm not so sure about anything anymore."

    "We return to our growing pile of today's failures, lumps of indiscriminate matter covered in muddy colors.  He keeps trying to simplify our experiment to make it easier, but it isn't helping."

    silver "Don't worry about the type of paint.  Or even the surface-don't even think of it as a canvas.  Just surface and color.  That's all we need to think about.  I'll make a vase, and you make some flowers.  One image.  It's cliché as all hell, but it should be simple enough to work."

    "I'm sure he's probably dying to try out some of the new things he's discovered. . .like getting into each others' heads, but I think we both know that's a dangerous game to play.  Right now we both could use a little simplicity.  There's still more to explore here, it's just a tamer beast. "

    alex "We've been trying \"simple\" all day, and it hasn't been working out."

    silver "Yes, I suppose you're right.  I thought that articulating it might help, though."

    alex "I have a feeling it won't."

    "He looks downward and shuffles his feet on the floor, seeming to be unsure of what to try next.  It's clear this isn't working-not right now, anyway."

    "A sudden thought seems to appeal to him. His eyes widen as if some muse has begun to whisper in his ear."

    silver "You know what?  Let's try something different.  Let's be loose.  Forget simple.  We'll both think of something new-anything, I don't care what it is, and don't tell me either.  Let's create something fantastic; forget about perfect for a minute, just make something."

    alex "I don't understand-Isn't that what we've been trying to do all along by making these paintings together?"

    silver "Yes, but this time we're not going to make something real.  We're going to make something unreal.  This is Virtuality we're in, remember.  We need to be pushing boundaries, not tiptoeing up to the ones that already exist.  It doesn't matter if it's perfect or like the things we already know, because it will be our own invention-there's no right or wrong there."

    alex "But if we can't even do something as simple as this.  How are going to create something even better?"

    silver "Well we won't know until we try, so how about you do away with all the questions and the negativity for a moment and give it a good, honest try?"
    "On the count of three, like always.  Ready?  One. . ."

    alex "W-wait, wait, wait.  I'm not ready!"

    silver "Two. . ."

    alex "Hey, hang on a minute!"

    "He's intent on ignoring me and instead flashes a mischievous smile."

    "I panic a little.  He said think of anything-but that's a whole lot of things I could think of!  I latch onto the first thing that comes to mind and roll with it; it's not exactly imaginative, but it's all I've got!"

    "I feel his mind reaching out to me, trying to make the connection we need to form whatever this is going to be.  A tie between our minds is forged.  I have some vague feeling of what he is thinking of, but it wasn't a complete image.  Something blue."

    silver ". . .Three!"

    "Finally, there is a decisive \"now\" moment between the two of us, and together, we propel the two images from our minds and into Virtuality space."

    "I hear something clatter to the floor as the feeling of mental strain from the connection begins to disappear."

    "I feel a tap on my shoulder.  I was still standing there with my eyes closed, feeling a bit out of it."

    "But when I feel his hand gently touch my shoulder, I open my eyes.  He gives me a curious look before grabbing my sleeve and pulling me over to the results of our latest effort.  He holds out his free hand with a flourish, as though a game show host revealing the grand prize from behind a curtain, with an appropriately cheesy smile on his face and wide eyes awaiting my reaction."

    silver "Well, what do you think of our little creation?"

    alex "Just what is it?"

    silver " Well, it's exactly what it looks like, I suppose."

    "He says, not sure what to make of it either, but he looks pleased."

    "\"It\" certainly is interesting; it stands at just around two feet tall and is a translucent blue, with a texture like blown glass.  And its form could only be described as a cartoonishly long-necked giraffe with a gentle face and papery wings far too small to be functional sprouting from its back.  But none of these things seems strange compared to the fact that it appears to be living.  Its sides appear soft, despite being transparent like glass, and expand as it breathes.  It walks around on its knobby legs and prances at our feet like a puppy."

    alex "Why's it like that?  Why's it moving?"

    silver "Because I wanted it to.  Just like you wanted it to be a giraffe.  By the way-a giraffe, Alex?  You have the opportunity to think of anything in the world and that's what you come up with?"

    "He gives me a playful push on the shoulder."

    alex "Hey come on, you didn't give me any time to think!"

    "He smiles and puts his hands on his knees, bending down to be almost on the level of the creature.  It immediately approached and propped its front legs up on his knees to meet him nose-to-nose.  This thing was too cute for its own good."

    silver "Well at least I thought to restrict its size a little; I didn't really need a giraffe bursting through the roof.  Were the wings your doing?"

    alex "Yeah.  Kind of stupid, I guess."

    silver "Only in that they're far too small for it to use them."

    "He gently holds one of the wings between his fingers and unfolds it, studying it intensely."

    silver "It looks like paper but feels soft; almost like a flower petal. . ."

    "He's murmuring to himself; I wouldn't be surprised if he had forgotten my presence."

    alex " So. . .do you think we've accomplished anything by doing this?"

    silver " Oh, absolutely.  I mean, look at this-this isn't just some object from real life we've managed to recreate.  It's a unique thing that no one else has seen before.  More than that, it's a combination of our own imaginations.  Just think-if you had the opportunity to be a little more creative, think of all the things we could make by combining our own independent thoughts.  I can't even really imagine all the possibilities because they aren't possible all by myself."

    "I can't help but smile when I see just how excited he is over this.  He picks up the creature in his arms, cradling it like it's an infant."

    silver "Come on, I think that's more than enough today.  I want to celebrate this success."

    alex "Wow, I'm surprised.  Normally you're so eager to keep moving onto the next thing.  I would have thought that after such a success, you'd be pretty much insatiable."

    silver "No, it's good to celebrate triumph.  What meaning is there in it if we just raise the bar and continue on?  We need to stop and enjoy this success before we keep climbing."

    alex "I suppose you're right.  Besides, I'm not one to complain about being done with work for the day."

    "I think that we were both also afraid that should we continue it might not happen again; that next time the results might be a huge mess.  We both realize that we should revel in what just happened before we try to reach higher and must suffer through many failures once again."

    "We walk together, him still clutching the wriggling creature like a teddy bear prize just won at a carnival.  He plops down into a chair at his table and stuffs a cookie halfway in his mouth and breaks it in half, offering the rest to our new little friend."

    alex "How does it act like it's alive?  Does it have some kind of AI telling it what to do?"

    "I seat myself next to him, rather than at my usual place across or a chair down from him.   He is forced to take a bite of the cookie before he can respond."

    silver "I'm not sure.  It must, I guess, since we're in Virtuality.  But usually something as lively as this needs to be preprogrammed in after a great deal of work.I just tried to imagine something acting happy and cute without really giving it a shape in my mind."

    alex "What if I had thought of an object instead of an animal? Would it still act like it's alive."

    silver "I'm not sure.  We'll have to experiment more to find out.  My guess is that that directive of how it should act might be interpreted other ways-maybe figured into its appearance somehow, making it look vibrant, or playing a nice tune, or something."

    "He continues to play with it, letting it prance around on the table and nose through our sweets.  He even lets it take a few droughts from his cup of tea, but I notice he himself does not drink from it after.  I've never seen a giraffe in real life, but I don't think they would act like this; this creature acts more like a puppy in my opinion.  Meanwhile, Silver Phoenix is cooing after every little thing it does."

    "I take the moment to look around the room that he had created for himself.  The room would have screamed of elegance if not for the fact that screaming was not so elegant-so it rather whispered or talked politely of its refinement.  The various objects reflected his wide-reaching tastes.  Scanning the rows of books I see various scientific topics and studies, historical books, and the occasional work of fiction."

    "I don't fit in with him."

    "This stark conclusion hits me from nowhere, but I realize that it is true.  Maybe once up a time I was a well-read aspiring law student.  I could quote from philosophers of old and modern law books alike, but the hardworking student in me is gone now.  I don't think I could tell Sophocles from Socrates anymore.  I no longer contemplate my own version of \"justice\" or dream about the future me putting my legal knowledge and reasoning to work.  My name was no longer destined to become a part of somebody's firm-no catchy TV jingle followed by a phone number.  All that was over."

    "I'd put away all that academia for something else.  I can't help but feel that Silver Phoenix is wrong about me; I feel as though I had more of an identity back then than I do now.  At least then I knew where I was going.  I don't even know what I want anymore, let alone how to get there."

    "Yet according to him, I'm better off now."

    "I guess I'm happier, if that counts.  I mean, this is probably much more exciting than what I would have ended up with otherwise."

    "Out of the corner of my eye I see him glance over with a concerned expression.  He stops playing with the creature and drags his chair closer to me."

    silver "You're thinking too much.  I can see it in your face.  What are you thinking about?"

    alex "I don't fit in with you at all."

    "I am surprised at my own honesty.  Did I even mean to say that?"

    silver "What are you talking about?"

    alex "I don't get why you like me, or why you think I'm so interesting.  I don't have the knowledge base that you do-I don't have the drive to learn more and more like you do.  I don't even know what I do, because it's just not remarkable."

    "He does that familiar motion of pinching the bridge of his nose and giving me a patient smile."

    silver "So because I know and take interest in various things, that somehow pushes you out of my league and makes you unworthy of me? "

    alex "Isn't that the way that the world normally works?  It's just natural that someone intelligent would want to be around someone equally intelligent."

    silver "Well for one thing, you are equally intelligent.  Just because you do not have a world of facts in your head or regularly try to read works from antiquity in their original Latin does not make you any less intelligent.  Just like being a lover of wisdom and discovery does not make you any more intelligent. "

    "I frown at him because once again he's trying to make me sound like a more interesting person than I am.  I start to rebut, but he cuts me off."

    silver "But that isn't the point.  What you need to accept, Alex, is that some things simply are.  Stop trying to look for reason or lack of reason behind them and just enjoy them as they are.  These things can't always be logical and fit your expectations.  In fact, it's best when they don't."

    "He places a hand over mine and looks at me with searching eyes for a moment before quickly changing the direction of the conversation."

    silver "So who do you think should hold onto this little scamp?"

    alex "What?"

    silver "Well he's got to stay somewhere."

    alex "Can't you just wish him away, or something?"

    "He looks genuinely shocked at this statement."

    silver "Why would I want this sweet little thing to go away-especially given how it was created.  I don't think we could ever recreate something exactly like this, Alex; don't you see how special it is?"

    alex "It's definitely really cool, but are you going to hang onto every single one of our experiments from now on?"

    silver " I'm sure I can find a place for them all."

    "He's not kidding at all.  I sigh and try to smile."

    alex "Well, it seems to make you really happy, so why don't you hold onto it?"

    "He nods with an eager grin, and I wonder if this was the right answer all along."

    "I shrug with a smile, as if to say, \"suit yourself\" and consider the matter settled.  He's still leaning close to me, looking up with a slightly dreamy look."

    alex "Well, I suppose that's it, then.  That's it for the day, isn't it?"

    "A crestfallen look crosses his face as he realizes the time."

    silver "Yes, I suppose that we're done with work for the day."

    alex "Good, then I guess I ought to get going."

    "I stand to leave, but he continues to look at me with that pitiful expression."

    silver "But. . .you know. . .you don't have to leave just because we're off the clock right now.  We could always just. . .spend some time together."

    alex "Yeah, I guess we could do that sometime."

    silver "'Sometime'. . .yes. . .I know it's a bit late, but why not tonight?"

    alex "Tonight?  I mean, what would we even do?"

    silver "Oh, um, I don't really know.  But I suppose we could find something to do.  Or perhaps we could go out somewhere, or even visit your place if that would be more comfortable."

    alex "It would probably be more fun if we planned it ahead, don't you think?"

    silver "Perhaps, but 'spontaneity is the spice of life', as they say."

    alex "Sure, but we've had a lot of excitement for today, and I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired.  I might even go to bed early tonight."

    silver "I suppose it was pretty tiring."

    "He says this rather flatly and I can tell that this was not the conclusion he wanted to arrive it.  But I really am tired. . ."

    alex "Right, well let me know if you think up something we could do for next time.  I'm gonna get going now, okay?"

    silver "Yeah, sure."

    "He says this in a despondent voice.  Something's wrong, but I have no idea what it is.  It's probably not my concern, anyway.  I start to return to my own room."

    alex "See you next t-"

    silver "Wait!"

    "I immediately stop the transfer to my office."

    alex "What?  Did you forget something?"

    silver "No, I-"

    "I look at him perhaps with a bit of impatience, because his face contorts in a way that I've never seen before.  He looks distressed."

    silver "Please. . ."

    "He turns his head away from me, as though ashamed."

    silver "Please don't leave yet."

    alex "What?"

    silver "I don't want you to go yet."

    alex "Yeah, I get that, but why?  We've spent a lot of time together today-I have to go sometime."

    silver "I. . ."

    alex "Is there something wrong?"

    silver "It's ridiculous.  It will dispel any respect you currently have for me."

    alex "Well if you won't tell me, then I don't really have any reason to stay here."

    "I mock as though I'm going to leave again, hoping that this will draw it out of him.  It feels a little cruel, but it works."

    silver "No, wait!  Okay, just give me a minute."

    "Success! "

    "I sit back down next to him.  I can't help but be more than a little concerned.  I've never seen him act like this before.  He's never bashful or apologetic about what he wants or the reasons why.  Why is this so hard all of a sudden?"

    "After a minute of struggling he turns to look me dead in the eyes."

    silver "I don't want you to go, because once you leave I'll be all alone again."

    alex "Oh come on, surely that's a bit of an exaggeration.  You know other people outside of me-why not get a hold of one of them?"

    silver "It just isn't the same.  I find their presence rather draining and yours. . .uplifting."

    alex "I can't stay here forever."

    silver "I know.  But just a little longer. . .please? "

    "He looks at me with such pleading eyes that I know I can't refuse."

    alex "Okay, fine, how about a half hour?  Is that enough?"

    "I can tell from his facial expression that it really wasn't, but he was too afraid to ask for more."

    alex "An hour?"

    "Still no.  I sigh. He really does look pitiful in this state."

    alex "I really can't stay here all night."

    silver "I know. . ."

    "He sounds a bit childish.  I tip my head back and place a hand over my face, trying to think.  Finally I sit forward."

    alex "Fine, why don't you come back with me for awhile?  We can just. . .hang out. . .or something, maybe watch a movie, and then you can leave whenever you feel like it."

    "He perks up immensely at this suggestion and nods with great enthusiasm, looking like a totally different person."

    "There's no way he'll possibly want to stay all night.  Not if he isn't in his own environment.  I'm counting on this fact, but I realize that I have no back-up plan if he doesn't.  I don't think I'd have the heart to just kick him out, either.   Oh geez, what am I getting myself into?"

    "He is on his feet almost immediately, urging me to hurry up.  I look down at the giraffe-creature he's still holding."

    alex "Is it. . .coming with us?"

    silver "Of course, I wouldn't want the little darling to get lonely!"

    "I feign annoyance, but can't help but end my act with a smile.  He just looks so happy coddling that thing."

    "Seriously, what am I getting myself into?"

    avatar "Oh!  I did not realize that you were returning with company, sir."

    alex "Neither did I. . . Would you mi-"

    avatar "I will prepare an evening meal for the two of you, if you wish."

    alex "Yeah, that would be good.  Nothing too heavy-I've had sweets shoved down my throat for hours now."

    "Silver Phoenix grins bashfully at my side and looks away."

    avatar "Of course, sir."

    silver "I apologize for the surprise, ma'am, it was rather last minute."

    "I think both [avatar_name] and I are surprised that he's apologizing to an AI for an inconvenience, but she reacts to it graciously and excuses herself from the room."

    "Silver Phoenix's mood has changed once more.  He stands beside me looking almost wary.  I wonder if he's afraid that I'll turn on him and make him go back alone.  No, I'm not that heartless."

    "He looks around with curiosity, in the way that I imagine I look at his space.  Of course, mine lacks the sort of refined display of tastes that his does.  Mine is more of a hodgepodge of personal likes and preference.  Modern and chic, but definitely not sophisticated."

    silver "So, what should we, um. . ."

    "He tugs at his collar nervously and leaves his sentence unfinished.  It was almost funny to see him so off his guard-he, who is normally so in control."

    alex "Well. . .we could watch a movie, I guess."

    "That ought to make the time go along faster, I suppose."

    silver "Yes, sure, a movie."

    alex "You can choose, though.  I'm not very picky when it comes to movies."

    "We wander towards the couch and settle down into it.  He sets the little creature down between us, but it soon toddles off to check out its new surroundings."

    "I call up a screen in front of us and turn over control of it to him so he can browse through the catalogue of things to watch.  I'm curious to see what he chooses.  Whatever it is, I hope that it isn't too cerebral.  My brain could really use a rest after the day I've had."

    "He flips through the catalogue looking alight with amusement once more.  I wait patiently, but when several minutes pass and he still has yet to even come close to choosing something, I flash him a skeptical look."

    silver "Sorry. . ."

    "He says this with such a dreamy smile on his face, that I can't really be mad."

    silver "I'm just always so indecisive with such things.  I don't like to choose just one thing."

    alex "Well you know, we can always do this some other time, so it doesn't really matter what you choose now."

    "A look crosses his face that seems to suggest that this thought had never crossed his mind before, and he finally begins to be more serious about selecting a single move.  At this point, [avatar_name] returns to deliver the food, having given us an ample amount of space.  It was a light salad for each of us and some cut up fruit, all set out in an attractive manner.  Perfect."

    "I put a piece of pineapple into my mouth and watch as he continues to flip through a slightly narrower selection of movies. "

    alex "Come on, just pick one already or it'll be time for you to go by the time you've finally decided."

    silver "Okay, okay"

    "He plucks up a slice of apple and pops it into his mouth.  Finally lands on a single movie and looks to me for approval.  I'm not very familiar with it, but it's some sort of old romantic comedy-not at all what I was expecting."

    alex "Wow, I didn't figure this as your kind of movie."

    "He looks immediately concerned."

    silver "I can pick a different one if it's not all right. . ."

    "he starts to go back through the catalogue"

    alex "No, no, seriously it's fine!  I'm just surprised at all."

    silver "Surprised. . .?"

    "He gives me suspicious look."

    alex "Well I didn't think. . .you know what, never mind.  Let's just watch the movie, okay?"

    "He starts it, looking pleased.  Our positioning on the couch is somewhat awkward.  He seems unsure as to whether sliding closer to me would be an allowed action, but leaves it alone for the time being as the plate of fruit is between us."

    alex "So, uh, have you seen this before?"

    silver " Oh, yes, many times.  It's one of my favorites."

    "He says this with such seriousness, too, that I know he's being sincere."

    "We pick away at the fruit and salad as the movie plays out.  To be honest, I don't understand his fascination with it.  It's one of the rom-com plots that's been passed on for decades now-boy and girl meet and have a rough start, finally get a better impression of each other, have cutesy adventures with each other with small mishaps along the way, and then somewhere an error of communication takes place causing a temporary break up, only for the forces of the world to bring them back together in the end.  The characters are pretty typical too, but I guess they have enough quirks unique to the movie that it doesn't come off as too cliché."

    "At some point we finish off the fruit and the plate is removed from between us.  Not long after that, I find that he is surreptitiously sneaking closer to me on the couch.  I use the term \"sneaking\" loosely, because I didn't even have to take my eyes off the screen to notice this.  But I did nothing to stop it, either."

    "By the time we're an hour into the movie, we're sitting arm-to-arm, with him leaning a bit of his weight onto me.  I can't help but wonder what's going through his head right then."

    "As the movie continues on, I feel more of his weight shift onto me, so much so that he's starting to push of against me and slip downward.  And by the time we've reached the \"tragic miscommunication\" part of the movie, his head is now resting against my left knee."

    "I can't tell if he's testing me, or if he really doesn't care, but I find that I don't mind it.  I really have been missing this sort of situation-this was one of the few things that Alyssa and I would do together, and it would almost always end with her head resting against my legs.  It's a comforting feeling, and I'm starting to think that I could get used to this.  It really wasn't freaking me out this time."

    "A few minutes of silence pass between us and I begin to realize that something seems different."

    "Curious, I bend down to get a peek at his face, and what I see are two shut eyes.  I double-check and suddenly notice the way that he had been breathing was slow and rhythmic-in other words, he was asleep.  I consider nudging him awake, but something stops me.  He looks so relaxed and content.  Why would I want to ruin that?  There was something oddly beautiful about those features, normally set in a deep, contemplative position, looking so serene."

    "I could turn off the movie, which I wasn't really all that interested in to begin with, but I don't want to do that either.  What if it woke him up?  Besides, I was content to stay as we were a little longer.  I sit through the rest of the movie, not really able to focus on it anyway.  No, all my thoughts are somewhere else."

    "Eventually the movie ends with an upbeat song and a wedding scene, complete with a look-who-caught-the-bouquet gag and amusing send off for the reunited couple."

    "I deliberate over whether or not to wake him now that it's over, but quickly come to the conclusion that I should try to slide gently out from underneath him and just let him be as he is for awhile.  I wonder if he ever just relaxes like this on his own.  I just couldn't picture it; all I could imagine was him hard at work at his desk, at best with a tray of sweets beside him."

    "I successfully get to my feet without disturbing him and take a moment to stretch.  Any trace of his usual intense and overbearing countenance was gone, replaced by the calm mask of sleep."

    "I really enjoy looking at that sleeping face, and doing so awakened my own feelings of contentment.  But I can't just stand there and stare at him forever-that would be awkward."

    "I step over to my computer and sit down in the chair before it.  Might as well get a little bit of work done.  Or at least check some emails.  Part of me just wants to go back to the couch, call up another movie, and put his head back against my leg for a little while longer, but I ignore this.  It really does sound nice-but I don't want to get too caught up in all this.  I feel like I've gotten too caught up in it already.  How did this turn into a date?  Geez. . ."

    "I start to rifle through all the new messages awaiting me.  Several missed calls from my mother.  She's actually been trying to call me for several days, but always when I'm out of the office or just unable to talk, and  I never remember to return the call.  I keep putting it off without realizing how much time is passing.  I could do it now, but it would be rude to do it with him in the same room. . ."

    "Tomorrow.  Tomorrow I'll definitely call her back."

    "I still feel guilty about the whole thing.  She's probably worried sick if I haven't been answering."

    "I take a minute to type out a quick email to her explaining that I've been busy and haven't had the opportunity to return her calls, but that I'd do so tomorrow.  It felt so cold-writing an email to my mother to try and explain why I've been too busy for her, but if it would get her to worry less, then it was probably worth it."

    "I was slowly drifting out of touch with my family.  It was funny, considering that they were why I got involved with the mage in the first place. But life has a funny way of working things out.  I tried to imagine that if things went further with he and I. . .how would I tell them?"

    "Would they be shocked?  Or even appalled or disgusted?  Would they be happy for me, or even indifferent?"

    "I felt so distant from them that I just couldn't even come up with a realistic expectation.  I'm sorry, Mom, I really do love you guys."

    "Maybe I'm getting too wrapped up in this Virtuality stuff. . .I don't remember the last time I saw them in real life.  Always through phone calls, and pictures exchanged through email. "

    "But everyone drifts away from their family at least a little bit when they grow up, right?  That's just part of becoming an adult, isn't it?  Somehow I'm not convinced that I'm not just trying to excuse my own behavior and lack of balance in life."

    "Behind me, Silver Phoenix stirs and sleepily sits up like a bear coming out of hibernation."

    alex "Hey, sleepy-head.  I thought you might sleep here all night at this rate."

    silver "Did I fall asleep on you?  I'm so sorry, that was very rude of me."

    "He really does look distraught over it."

    alex "No, it's okay.  We've both had a long day."

    silver "I guess. . .that means I should be leaving now."

    "That look that he wore earlier, when he was pleading with me not to go makes a return.  Aww geez, why am I such a sucker for it?"

    alex "Well, I mean, you don't have to.  I'm afraid there really isn't anything exciting to do here, but if you want to just hang around here for awhile, I guess that's fine."

    silver "Really. . .?"

    alex "No, I'm lying straight to your face right now-of course you can stay."

    "He looks overjoyed at this, even more so when I get up from my computer to rejoin him on the couch.  For awhile, we just sit there talking about anything that comes to mind.  I tease him a little more for falling asleep, and he teases me back for letting him."

    "I hate that I keep revisiting the idea, but it really does remind me of the nights when Alyssa and I would hang out.  But it was also very different.  I felt at ease with him.  With Alyssa, it always felt as though some expectation hung in the air.  I knew that I wasn't what she really wanted, and so did she.  Yet it was still somehow better than being alone.  Looking back now, I'm not totally convinced that that was true, but it sure was a comforting thought at the time."

    "But here with him, we drift easily from topic to topic without pressure, and even when we drift into silence, we can share that comfortably for awhile before the conversation strikes back up.  It's something I've never had before.  I feel that I'm quickly forgetting why I ever disliked him.  The more he talks, the more respect I have for him, even if there is still some small semblance of arrogance tailing on his words; something, which I am sure not even he is aware of.  He's kind and curious."

    "As we talk, our hands slip over each other's and find themselves entwined.  A part of me does not understand how this is all happening, and wishes for it to stop long enough for my mind could catch up, but the rest of me does not want that."

    "Two more hours pass like this-just talking.  It was beautiful."

    "But finally he decides that he is ready to leave.  He looks content as he stands, and not like a puppy being abandoned upon a street corner as he did before.  There's no door to walk him out to, but I stand to see him off anyway."

    "But before he can leave, I step close to him and place my hands on either side of his head as he had done earlier.  But this time, instead of hovering my face mere inches away from his, I bring mine all the way to his.  I tip my head to the side and our lips align in a hesitant kiss, which quickly melts into a confident and passionate one.  I feel his arms wrap around my back and pull me closer, and I do the same to him.  I don't know how long it lasts, but every second is wonderful."

    "Eventually, we pull away.  I look down, unsure of just what inspired me to do that, while he smiles at me, blushing."

    silver "I don't know if you're just humoring me, or if you truly meant that, but either way, thank you for this entire night.  It's been wonderful.  I've felt alone for quite a long while, and you are the one person I know that changes that.  So thank you, once more, for everything."

    "I really am not sure what to say.  \"You're welcome\" didn't seem appropriate somehow.  He sees this and nods."

    silver "It's okay, you don't have to say anything right now.  I'll leave you to your thoughts, as I'm sure you have a lot of them to sort through.  Goodnight, Alex."

    "And then he's gone.  I'm stuck somewhere between relief that he is gone and missing his presence already.  He really did bring some life to this space.  I guess I can understand his feelings of loneliness-I think I may have been having them too, without realizing it."

    "There is a vast difference in a space from the time that someone you enjoy having around is there to the time after they've left.  It can transform a space in almost unimaginable ways.  [avatar_name] was still here if I was craving for company, but I knew it just wouldn't be the same."

    #TODO Not sure what this means.
    #">>>>[TOFF1]<<<<>"

    "What a day."

    "I plop down into my office chair, intent on keeping my mind occupied on something light and inconsequential to my life for a while.  But I quickly become aware of a quiet shuffling going on beneath my feet.  In the real world, I might have been concerned it was a mouse that had wandered into my space, but accidental rodent infestations are not fortunately not a part of the reality retained in Virtuality."

    "I take a peek beneath my desk and see none other than the little giraffe creature.  Silver Phoenix must have forgotten it when he left.  I could go return it, but I don't want to disturb him if he went to go sleep."

    "But what am I to do with this silly little thing that's now tripping over my feet?"

    "Feeling pity for the dopey creature, I pick it up and place it in my lap.  It looks up at me with exuberance and quickly takes to gnawing at my shirt.  I don't remember it being this mischievous when Silver Phoenix was around!"

    "Maybe we should try to train it. . .but shouldn't it have a name, first?"

    "The time turns to a new hour and, like clockwork, [avatar_name] enters the room to check on me.  However, her inquiries about my needs are derailed when she notices the creature.  She begins to smile."

    avatar "I see we still have another guest, sir."

    alex "I guess you could say that, although he's more of a nuisance than a guest."

    "Of course, I don't really mean that.  I'm actually sort of warming up to having the little thing around.  I bet Silver Phoenix will tease me if I ever start requesting to take him with me sometimes."

    avatar "Does the 'nuisance' have a name?"

    "She reaches down to pet it affectionately.  I guess not even AI's can resist something cute."

    alex "No, it doesn't have a name.  Maybe we should name it right now?  I bet that would be a nice surprise for Silver Phoenix-we could give it a cute name he'd really like."

    avatar "A cute name?  Like what?"

    alex "Well, he really likes sweet things, so maybe something related to that."

    avatar "\"Sweetie\", perhaps?"

    alex "That's a nice idea, but I think it's a little too on the nose."

    avatar "The name of a candy, then?  Such as \"Caramel\"?"

    "She seems to really be having fun with this!"

    alex "That's even closer, but still not quite right for this one."

    avatar "How about \"Toffee\", then?"

    alex "Toffee. . .hmm. . ."

    "I look down at the odd little creature wriggling in my lap like a puppy."

    alex "I think Toffee's a great name!"

    "[avatar_name] looks immensely pleased that her suggestion was a hit.  I look down at the newly dubbed Toffee and repeat its name to it.  It tilts its head to the side and looks at me as though I've just said something odd but intriguing."

    "I repeat the name and this time it props its front legs up on my stomach to get itself nose-to-nose with me.  I say it one more time and it playfully \"bonks\" its head against mine.  Maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but I think it's starting to recognize the name."

    "[avatar_name] and I continue to play with Toffee, all the while repeating the name and checking for responses, for several minutes before a familiar presence unexpectedly enters the room."

    silver "Oh, thank goodness, I was starting to worry!  I'd forgotten we brought it with us when we came over here and have been looking all over for that silly little thing.  Ahem, um, pardon the intrusion by the way."

    alex "It's all right-we were just having some fun together."

    silver "Yes, I'm quite surprised to see you playing with it!  And here I thought you didn't even like it."

    alex "Oh, I'd say we're getting along quite nicely, even if it's a little troublemaker sometimes."

    "As if to accentuate this point, Toffee begins to gnaw lazily on my shirt again.  I can't help but chuckle at this."

    silver "You really are all smiles right now-did I miss out on something?"

    alex "Well, I wanted to surprise you later, but you might be excited to know that [avatar_name] helped me come up with a cute little name for him.  I think he even recognizes it already!"

    silver "O-oh, er, what did you come up with?"

    alex "Toffee!  Isn't it a cute name?"

    "It's plain in an instant that I'm not going to get the exuberant response I was hoping for.  In fact, Silver Phoenix is practically pouting."

    alex "What's wrong?  I thought you'd love it!"

    silver "It is adorable, but I must admit that I already had a name I was going to propose to you tomorrow-\"Subject Zero\".  You know, because he's now the origin point of success in our experimentations."

    alex "Well, it makes sense, but. . ."

    "I pick up Toffee and wriggle him in Silver Phoenix's face."

    alex "Do you really think a name like that really fits a cute face like this?"

    silver "I suppose not. . ."

    "I can see he's trying to smile as Toffee begins to nuzzle his face, but he's still sticking fast to his pouty performance.  I suspect it's less about the actual name and more about the fact that he didn't get to participate in the naming."

    silver "So it's Toffee, eh?"

    "Toffee perks its head up when the name is said.  This time the smile comes through on Silver Phoenix's face."

    silver "Well, it seems the name has stuck, hasn't it?  I guess that's that."

    "He sighs, but it's all for show since he's still smiling, and takes Toffee from me."

    silver "I really did come here to retrieve, er, Toffee, so I guess we should be going for real this time."

    alex "Goodnight! . . .Again."

    silver "Yes, goodnight. . .again."
    "He waves and then just like that he and Toffee are gone."

    "I sigh and lean back in my chair.  I can't even quantify the ways in which my life has become strange anymore-they're just too numerous."

    "But would I really want it any other way?"

    #TODO [scene change - *CON1.5]

    "I forgot to call my mom the next day."

    "And the day after that."

    "I continued to forget."

    "I don't really have a legitimate excuse for it.  We didn't really accomplish much in our experiment, either.  Don't get me wrong, we were having a lot of success in it and were able to move onto increasingly more complicated things, but truthfully, we weren't putting much of our allotted time into the experiment.  We weren't slacking off either, but we probably could have been much more focused."

    "Our day together no longer ended with our scheduled work time.  We spent the evenings together now, talking, watching movies (usually his pick). . .And  as our emotional closeness grew, so did our forays into the shallow end of the deep pool that was physical intimacy."

    "Any and all feelings of awkwardness was slowly being peeled away.  Things became natural between us, he began to loosen up a little around me.  It was great, and made our work sessions together something to really look forward to."

    "I still wondered what people would think and say when word got out.  I mean, I wasn't some worldwide icon, but I was a minor star in Virtuality-at least until I retired.  People would still know my name, and people definitely still remembered Silver Phoenix.  But I ultimately decided that I didn't really care.  Let them talk if they want to; it wasn't really anybody's business but ours.  Or at least, that's what I told myself.  In reality, I was still a little scared.  But time would take care of that for us, I guess. "

    "I found myself often in a dream-like state.  As far as I could remember, I've never had this happen before.  Even as I sit at my desk trying to focus and do some mundane personal accounting work, I find that I can't focus."

    avatar "Sir, you asked me to remind you again to call your mother.  You've missed a total of eleven calls in the past two weeks."

    alex "You're right, I should call her in just a bit."

    avatar "Sir. . . need I remind you that you said that last night?"

    alex ". . .I guess you've got me there.  I'll do it right now, okay?   Thank you for reminding me."

    avatar "Glad I could be of service, sir."

    "Rather than disappearing, she remains there to make sure I do as I promised.  Once I start dialing my  mother, she leaves the room, apparently satisfied."

    "My mother picks up the call, looking first relieved and then very quickly her expression turns to exasperation."

    mom "Alex!  Do you have any idea how worried I've been?  I've been trying to call you for two weeks now and you haven't once picked up.  Is everything okay?"

    alex "Yes, everything's fine, Mom.  In fact, everything's great.  Didn't you get my email?  I said that I just hadn't had the time to return your calls."

    mom "Of course I got the email, but how am I not supposed to worry when you won't talk to me face-to-face.  For all I knew, you could have been dead and someone else was writing that email."

    alex "Well, you know that's not true, now, so you can relax, Mom."

    "Her cheeks are still flushed with the fury that only a worried mother could have, but she calms down a little and starts to talk normally."

    mom "All right, but don't you dare let it happen again.  Not without a real good excuse.  I don't care if you're working a lot-you can call me at any damn time of the night if that's the only time when you're free."

    alex "Duly noted, Mom.  So what were you calling for before I so wrongly worried you?"

    mom "I was calling to tell you that everything is going all right with your father, and also that we've been able to leverage a small reduction on his medical payments per month.  So maybe you won't have to work so much that you won't call your mother."

    alex "You're not gonna let this one go, now are you?"

    mom "If it keeps you from making that mistake again, then you can bet that I won't.   Anyway. . ."

    "I could sense a small amount of tension in her voice.  Like she was hesitant to say what came next."

    mom "Anyway. . .in light of. . .recent events. . .I also did a little research."

    alex "Research?  Mom, I'm kind of confused.  What are you talking about here?"

    mom "I'm going to be honest, Alex, and say that you really are worrying me.  Being out of touch like this. . .it just isn't like you.  And I don't just mean recently.  Even before what happened with your father, we felt like you were growing apart from us.  Now that was to be expected with you growing up, but this is different.  You've become almost. . .obsessive with Virtuality, ever since you broke up with Alyssa. . ."

    alex "Mom, that's not wha-"

    mom "Just let me talk, Alex."

    "Her voice was wavering a little, and I could tell that she didn't exactly feel comfortable talking about all this. She was never one to be harsh on me as a kid; that was dad's job."

    mom "Now, I'm sure that Dad and I don't know the full story about what happened with Alyssa, but we understand most of it.  While we understand how you felt, how you've reacted. . .well, we're not so sure that it has been the healthiest reaction.  We could understand it if you decided law school was not for you anymore-kids your age change their mind all the time about what they want to do in life.  But you've gone in a totally different direction, and we're not sure if it's a decision you've ever fully confronted."

    alex "Mom, I'm not just some jobless bum.  I'm working in Virtuality.  A lot.  There's nothing unhealthy about it."

    mom "It's just. . . you seem to have neglected the real world entirely in the past year.  You hardly ever call, and you never come see us in real life.  Now we're not stupid-we understand that Virtuality is something good, but when you're choosing it over the real world, it gets dangerous.  Do you even remember that all of it isn't even real?"

    alex "Mom, I know this isn't the real world, but that doesn't make it any less legitimate of a place to spend my life."

    "She gives a sigh in exasperation, sounding almost grief-stricken.  I realize that I sound just like him right now."

    mom "I'm not alone here, hon.  I've been researching this and there's  a whole therapy practice based around Virtuality addiction."

    alex "Mom. . ."

    mom "And I've found a local doctor, not too far from where you live, who specializes in seeing patients who-"

    alex "Mother, I'm not going to go to therapy over this.  I'm in control of myself.  I know what's real and what's not.   I-"

    mom "Please, just humor your mother on this one.  I don't care if you decide you don't want to even talk to us anymore because of this.  Just for one session, please humor me. "

    alex "Mom, I. . ."

    mom "Thank you, Alex.  That's a huge relief."

    alex "But really, Mom, I can handle myself."

    mom "I know, Alex, but with all those studies that you see on the TV, you can't help but worry."

    "I sigh, knowing that there's just no convincing her.  She eagerly gives me the information for the therapist and makes me promise to call right after we hang up.  I'm not happy about it, but I agree.  I feel like I owe it to her-if I hadn't been ignoring her, maybe she wouldn't have gotten this idea in the first place."

    "We chat a little bit more, and she even gets Dad on the phone for a few minutes, but things are still tense, and so we do not stay on the line for long."

    mom " I really am sorry for pushing all this on you, Alex.  I try not to be that pushy, controlling mother, but I have to be once in awhile."

    "She forces a weak smile, but I can see she's still worried."

    alex "It's okay, Mom.  Well, I've, uh, got to go call that therapists' office before they close, I guess."

    mom "Yes, you do that.  I love you, dear-call us more often, or better yet, come visit."

    alex "I'll try mom---Love you, too.  Goodbye!"

    mom "Bye, Alex, be good."

    "She hangs up, and I sit in the silence for a little while.  Geez, I did not need this right now.  I look at the information I had copied down from her.  Dr. R. Giamo, Specializing in Virtuality & Game Addiction.  Better get this over with. . ."

    "As I waited for the office to pick up the call, I realized that I hadn't said a thing about Silver Phoenix to Mom.  Of course I didn't-there'd been no reason to talk about the man who was supposed to be my boss, after all.  I could have brought it up myself, but I wasn't ready yet.  But somehow I felt like I was trying to hide it, instead."

    "A cheery receptionist finally picks up the call and is more than happy to set up an appointment for me.  Her tone is supposed to be pacifying, I guess, in order to calm any doubts about signing on for all this.  I have several minutes during which we're setting up various insurance and personal information in which I could have just cancelled the whole thing and left it at that, but I choose to go through with it, reminding myself that I don't have to come back a second time.  The receptionist tells me I have an appointment one week from today, and that she's formatting some intake surveys for me to fill out and send to them before then, to help the doctor formulate my treatment quicker.  Treatment.  Ugh."

    "After I hang up I take a moment to look over the forms she sent me.  Questions like, \"how many hours on average per day do you spend in Virtuality?\" or ones where I have to rate on a scale of 1-10 how well \"I feel in touch with the real world\".  Geez, it's like they think I'm some kind of lunatic or something.  The rest of the world uses Virtuality just as much as I do, yet no one calls them \"addicted\"."

    "I leave the forms for later, deciding I don't want to think about this anymore today.  It's still early yet.  Today is technically my day off, but I guess I could go see him."

    "My mother is silent on the other end.  She isn't happy, but I think she's still more worried than angry."

    alex "I'm sorry, Mom."

    "I can see she's trying not to cry in front of me.  Geez, I feel like such a jerk right now.  But I'm not going to go to a doctor if I feel like I don't need help."

    alex "Mom. . ."

    mom "I know, Alex, I know.  You're not going.  Fine.  I can't force you to.  I won't drive you away by continuing to push the point."

    "She takes a deep sigh and then begins to talk normally, as if the whole ordeal had never happened.  The tension is still there, though.  She gets my dad to come on the line briefly too, and I can tell that he's also a bit disappointed in me.  I'm sorry guys, but I've gotta do what I think is right, here."

    "We don't talk much longer.  The air is just too heavy between us for that."

    "When the call ends I lean back in my chair with my hands over my face.  Why did she have to go and get involved like this?  I know she's worried, but she just doesn't understand.  I feel so stressed out, and it's only midday.  It's my day off, but. . . he should probably be at his office.  I could definitely use some de-stressing."

    "When I arrive, he seems surprised to see me, but his face quickly brightens.  He's just standing in the middle of the room, a tea cup in hand.  He doesn't really seem to be doing much of anything."

    silver "Oh. . .Alex.  Is there something I can do for you?"

    alex "Not really, I just kind of wanted to come over and, I don't know, hang out or something.  If you're free, that is.  Heh, I guess I should have asked first. . ."

    silver "Nonsense, you're welcome over anytime."

    "He sets down his tea cup on the table and pulls me into a hug.  One of those line-blurring hugs that makes the exact nature of our relationship that much harder to understand.  It's a nice feeling, but a confusing one.  He lets me go and smiles warmly at me, a hand still resting on my shoulder. "

    alex "Am I. . .interrupting anything?"

    silver "No, not at all.  I was just sort of wafting around the room, lost in my own thoughts."

    alex "Anything important?"

    "What I really want to say is:  \"please tell me about it; I want to hear about all the things you think about\".  But would that be too much?"

    silver "No. . .just random musings of mine.  I ramble no less in my thoughts than I do out loud."

    "He laughs a little awkwardly and shakes his head.  I don't think that's all there is to it, though."

    silver "In any case, I'm glad that you've come to visit."

    alex "Is that so you can ramble at me, now?"

    "Playful ribs like this have become almost commonplace for us.  It's strange. . .considering where we started from, but all seems normal in the moment.  The progression of things. . .just makes sense somehow."

    silver "I'm afraid I'm not all that used to hosting company, though.  What, um, what would you like to do?  Are you hungry?  I could maybe bring out a tray of sweets and we could just sit around and chat, or maybe we could put on a movie?   Or perhaps-"

    "I hold up a hand to cut him off, otherwise he'd just go on throwing out suggestions for half the night.  I didn't really care what we did.  I just didn't want to think about the appointment I made."

    alex "Um, how about we just watch something for now?"

    "I could use a distraction. . ."

    silver "Sure.  You get to pick, though-I picked last time."

    alex "Does that mean I have permission to fall asleep on you this time, too?"

    "I grin when he blushes just a little and glances away.  But the conversation with my mother is still in the back of my head, and my smile quickly fades and I begin wondering again just what was going on between us.  Of course, this doesn't slip past Mr. Perceptive, here.  He tips his head to the side, like a bloodhound picking up on an interesting sound."

    silver "Is everything all right, Alex?"

    alex "Everything's fine."

    silver "No. . .no, you sound far from fine.  Come on, sit down, let's talk about this."

    "He leads me over to a sofa and lounge  chair set on the other side of the room, without much room for protest.  He sits me down and places a hand over mine in an overly supportive gesture.  I stare at this, even more confused than before."

    alex "Look, I'm fine, I'm just a little stressed is all.  I just need something else to think about for awhile."

    silver "Why would you need that if nothing's wrong?  Why won't you tell me about it?"

    alex "Who says I have to?"

    "I say this trying to be coy, but I think it comes out defensive.  A frown crosses his face and he pulls back a little."

    alex "Oh, come on, I didn't mean it that way.  You don't have to give me that look. . .I'm handling it, okay?  You don't have to worry about it."

    "I force a pretty convincing smile to show that it wasn't worth dwelling on anymore."

    silver "Only if you can tell me truthfully that it's got nothing to do with me.  Even then, I won't be happy, but I guess I'll leave you alone about it."

    alex "It's about Virtuality, not you."

    "I guess that's pretty much the truth."

    silver "What do you mean?"

    alex "I just did what you asked me to, now you have to leave it alone like you said you would.  Please?"

    "He pouts; somehow I knew he wouldn't leave it alone."

    silver "I didn't ask what it was about.  I asked whether or not it concerned me.  You're avoiding something."

    "Damn, why does he have to be so sharp?  He is never going to leave it alone.  Unless. . ."

    alex "Oh?  Well how's this for avoiding?"

    "I launch myself forward towards his surprised face and launch an affectionate attack on him that ends up being quickly turned against me.  Before I know it, my arms are locked in his firm but careful grip.  He grins at me in a goofy way that I'm not used to seeing."

    silver "Oh my, if that's what your reflexes are like, then I don't think you would have fared well against me in an actual battle."

    alex "I wasn't even trying!"

    silver "Not even trying?  Somehow I don't believe that."

    "He uses his grip to turn me around on the sofa and pull me back against him in a sort of embrace.  I'm too shocked by the move to really put up any resistance, and the end-result is too nice for me to want to get out of it; I just sort of settle in as he releases my arms.  He wraps his own arms around my waist and holds me there, resting his chin on my shoulder.  Well this wasn't what I expected. . . but it's okay.  Actually, it's better than okay.  It's comforting and warm.  I just feel content sitting like this.  It's assuring."

    "We sit there without talking for awhile, but it isn't awkward.  Every now and then he'll reach up and brush some of my hair into what he thinks is a better place.  We don't turn on a TV show or make small talk-we just sit there leaning back like this.  But, of course, that silence couldn't just go on forever."

    silver "This is nice."

    alex "Mm-hm"

    "It's such a simple statement, but one that couldn't be more true.  I want to ask him more than ever now just what we are together.  What is this between us?  Is it a relationship?  Are we committed?  Or is this just fun while it lasts?  I want to ask these things, but I don't want to risk ruining this moment by saying something that could possibly make it take an unpleasant turn."

    "Maybe another time.  But soon, because these thoughts were beginning to turn on me like a restless beast in a cage."

    alex "I've been thinking. . .maybe we should start making plans to meet up with each other in other places. . .you know?  Like outside of our offices."

    "I turn my head to the side so that I can kind of see his face. . .and his reaction."

    silver "Like a date?"

    "He makes it sound almost obscene the way he rolls over the words.  But he's smiling, so that's a good sign."

    alex "Yes, like a date."

    "Now it sounded funny when I said it.  Maybe it was just because the word was still foreign between us yet."

    silver "I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.  I suppose just sitting around and watching TV all the time would get boring. . .Of course, we'll have to think more about where we would go, and-"

    alex "Well, in any case, we can do that some other time – after all, today's a good day to just stay in and laze around, don't you think?"

    "He smiles and buries his chin deeper into my shoulder, planting a little kiss as he pulls back."

    silver "Absolutely!"

    "He lets me go and we slide into a more comfortable but still pretty close position on the sofa where we can both see the screen."

    silver "As promised, you get to pick this time."

    "He lets me take control, and stares expectantly at the screen while I sift through our options."

    alex "How about this one?"

    "I'm pointing to a courtroom drama.  Old interests die hard, I guess?  I wasn't expecting an overly enthusiastic response, but I definitely wasn't expecting the response I did get, though:  a crinkled up nose and furrowed brow."

    alex ". . . I'm guessing not, then?"

    "He shakes his head suddenly as though snapping out of a trance; he seems unaware that he was even making that face."

    silver "Hmm?  Oh, um, sorry, I guess I just don't get into this type of thing.  I know it's your pick, but would you mind choosing something different?"

    alex "Sure, no problem.  After all, I'm more interested in the company than the entertainment."

    "There's that blush rising to his cheeks again.  There's nothing more fun that catching him off guard for a change."

    "I flip through all the different shows, but I'm quickly finding that most of it is unfamiliar and unappealing to me.  It's actually been awhile since I've just sat down and watched TV; I guess I don't relax much on my own anymore.  I finally land on a show that I am just barely familiar with-I know it's definitely not my thing, but I'm sure that it's his.  It's some sitcom with cutesy romantic fluff at the heart of the plot-of course he'll like it."

    "He gives me a questioning look as he notices my selection, but doesn't ask out loud or protest.  I don't think it matters much to either of us what we watch."

    "I don't think I could concentrate on the show, even if I wanted to.  I don't think either of us could."

    "Not long after the opening theme of the first episode plays he starts to pull me closer until we're not just sitting near each other, we're practically intertwined.  He lies in front of me on his side and pulls my arm so that it's draped over his waist.  His head is resting against my other arm.  He stays there for awhile, content, and now laughing along with the show, looking up at me every now and again for approval.  I'm smiling every time he glances up, but not because of the show."

    "To be honest, by the time the first few episodes have finished, I have only a vague idea of who the characters are and how they're connected.  Those feelings of ultimate comfort and contentment are back, only stronger than ever.  It's a feeling that I don't think I could live without anymore, now having experienced it, except only temporarily."

    "I play with his hair a little and start to wonder would it might be like to fall asleep like this-holding him in my arms this way.  These thoughts only bring forward more feelings of warmth.  It's sappy and not at all like me, but I just can't get over it."

    "After awhile I realize that I have no desire to watch the show, so I simply stop and press my face against his neck.  I close my eyes and just take in everything.  The sweet scent he carries with him, his quiet breathing and occasional chuckles, the warmth of his body, and how well he fits in my arms.  It's a perfect fit.  This is nice-amazing, even, but this isn't the only thing I'm thinking about.  I picture us in the midst of a more intimate scene, our bodies entangled, lit with passion, and our lips and hands exploring each other's skin.  I know that I'm just a touch away from making this a reality, but I'm also happy as I am right now."

    "As if sensing my thoughts, he turns over so that we're face to face.  He touches my cheek and watches me closely. We're so close that our noses are almost touching.  He comes even closer so that our bodies fit together the way a key fits into a keyhole."

    silver "Thank you for staying."

    alex "You don't have to thank me.  This is nice."

    "Really nice.  The image of what else we could be doing still burns hot in my head.  Even more so now that we're so close together.  Still. . .I feel something else.  I'm nervous."

    "I like having him so close, but it is a little unnerving.  He still has such a powerful presence, even in such a vulnerable state.  He starts to play with my hair."

    silver "It's nice not spending the whole night alone."

    alex "Mm-hmm."

    "It really is."

    "I wait for him to make a move, to pull me into a kiss that would light the fires between us and make that image in my head a reality.  But it doesn't come-not this time, anyway.  He lays there blinking at me, looking content as he runs a hand along my face and chest.  For once he seems happy to leave things as they are."

    "I can't help myself any longer."

    "I pull him into the kiss that I was wishing he'd give me.  He seems surprised at first, but quickly throws himself into it.  When our lips finally part, he stays very close for a long time, kissing at my neck and jaw line before finally dropping down onto my chest with his arms around me."

    "This isn't exactly what I had in mind, but this is good.  I wrap my arms around him, one caressing his back and the other cradling his head.  He presses an ear to the center of my chest and takes a deep breath."

    silver "I can hear your heart beating."

    alex "That's good, that means I'm not dead yet."

    "I'm surprised when he gives a little chuckle.  I expected him to chide me for the lame joke.  He keeps listening, closing his eyes as though it will help.  We stay like this for a long time.  No longer moving or talking or doing anything of importance.  We just enjoy the simplicity of silence and the comfort of human touch for a very long stretch of time. "

    giamo "So. . . Alex-or do you prefer Alexander?"

    alex "Uhm, Alex is fine, I guess."

    giamo "You look a little uncomfortable; is there anything I could do to make you feel a little more relaxed in this environment?  Would you like a cup of water?"

    "Perhaps I've gotten spoiled, but it seemed a paltry offering compared to the usual tea and cookie spread I got from Silver Phoenix.  Dr. Giamo didn't seem completely oblivious to this fact."

    giamo "O-or. . .I could also get you some coffee from our lounge in the back?"

    alex "Do you. . .you wouldn't happen to have any tea, perhaps?"

    giamo "Ah, I'm afraid that's the one thing we don't have.  But I'll make a note of it and try to have some on hand soon.  That's actually a pretty good idea, thank you, Alex.  You're sure I can't get you anything that we have right now?"

    alex "You're, uh, welcome.  And thanks for the offer, but I'm fine.  I guess I'm just a bit nervous-I've never done this kind of thing before."

    giamo "Of course.  Well if you think of anything, please, don't hesitate."

    "The therapist gets up from his chair seated directly across from mine and retrieves a set of papers.  I just can't get over how old he is.  I mean, maybe he isn't that old, but how can they expect someone like him to understand Virtuality?  He probably hates it so much because it interferes with his \"good old days\" where everyone just met face-to-face all the time."

    "He sits back down with the papers in hand and is examining them intently.  I try to find a comfortable way to sit in my own chair, but the task seems impossible.  Why did I agree to this again?"

    "After a moment, he takes a sharp intake of breath and begins the session."

    giamo "So, Alex, what I have here are the results of the preliminary questionnaires you answered after making the appointment.  Do you remember it?"

    alex "Yes."

    "Of course I do, it was only a week ago. . ."

    giamo "We've run a check for typical warning signs of what we've deemed dangerous or obsessive behaviors based on your answers.  Now let me tell you, Alex, you're far from the worst case I've seen.  In fact, you're miles behind them, but there are a few indications that you're beyond the healthy range of Virtuality use; based on your answers, you're shown to spend a much higher than average amount of time in Virtuality, and a low amount of time doing activities involved in the outside world and contacting people you know outside of Virtuality.  Do you feel these things are true, Alex?"

    alex "Well it seems that the only answer is \"yes\", Doctor."

    giamo "Please, you can call me Paul, if you'd like.  Doctor's fine, too.  Whatever you're comfortable with.  And I'm really searching for your own opinion of matters here.  Yes, we have our own ideas here of what \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" uses of Virtuality are, but what matters most is that we are helping you, the patient, achieve your own goals in regard to your own behavior."

    alex "Well to be honest, Paul, I'm actually not here because I feel concerned about my own behavior.  I'm doing this for my mother-she's worried that I'm becoming addicted or something, and she said she'd feel better if I made at least one appointment here, to try it out, you know."

    giamo "Mm-hm."

    "He doesn't look disappointed or annoyed-or if he is, he does well to hide it behind a wall of patience and thoughtfulness.  He taps his pen against his lip and glances down at the papers again."

    giamo "Then can I assume, Alex, that you feel there is no problem at all with how you use Virtuality?  And please, don't think I'm accusing you here or anything, I just want to get to the bottom of your own thoughts.  This is an earnest question."

    alex "Yes, I think how I use Virtuality is perfectly healthy.  Sure, I spend most of my time in it, but I'm not necessarily escaping from reality.  It just sort of is a part of my reality.  I know what's real and what's not, and a lot of the time it doesn't matter.  It's my career and how I keep in touch with people I just normally wouldn't otherwise."

    giamo "So then would you say it's not an escape, as some others might presume, but just another vehicle to a perfectly valid way of life?"

    alex "Yes."

    giamo "I see. . .So can we talk, for a moment, about the ways that you choose to spend the amount of time you do in Virtuality."

    alex "Well I guess that changes a lot-kind of like how most people change up the things they do from time to time.  I used to work fighting in the tournaments for awhile; that was back when I first started getting into Virtuality."

    giamo "And that would be when your time spent in Virtuality also began to increase?"

    alex "Yes."

    giamo "So what changed all that?  You said that you used to, so what are you doing now?"

    alex "I'm. . .I'm doing some private research under another individual that will help improve Virtuality.  When it's finished, people will be able to do amazing things that aren't at all possible in the real world."

    giamo "Oh?  And so you spend most of the time doing this research, then?"

    alex "A big part of it, yes.  It's kind of my job, now."

    giamo "And what about the rest of your time?  What else do you do?"

    alex "I just relax, mostly."

    "Well, that's not entirely wrong.  I consider my time with him relaxing."

    giamo "And when you're relaxing, are these things that you could possibly be doing outside of Virtuality and still get the same quality in the experience?"

    alex "I. . .don't think so.  After all, I-"

    "I can't see him in the real world. . ."

    giamo "What was it you were just going to say?  Don't worry, I'm not here to judge; I'm just looking to gather information about you."

    alex ". . .There's someone that I like to spend my time with there.  So, yes, it would be different."

    giamo "And is this person someone important to you?  A good friend, perhaps?"

    alex "Yeah, I guess you could say that."

    giamo "I sense that there's a bit more to this situation, Alex."

    alex "Well, I guess it's kind of a relationship, but I don't see why that matters."

    giamo "Really?  Because to me it seems to make a great deal of sense that you would want to spend more time in Virtuality if you have a significant other there.  But may I challenge this a little?  Would it be possible to meet this person in the real world?  Or have you already?"

    alex "No, we haven't.  But I don't really think it would be possible. . ."

    giamo "Are they that far away, or do they simply not want to?"

    alex "I don't think they're very far away, and I've never asked, but it just never seemed like an option that was on the table, I guess.  We're both still pretty private when it comes to our personal lives."

    giamo " Do you feel like it would be a good thing if you two were to try meeting in person?  Or even just to ask them about the possibility?"

    alex "I don't know. . .I guess I haven't really considered it before."

    giamo "Well consider it now.  Do you think it could further your relationship if you did?"

    alex "Well I guess it might be nice to meet hi- err, them in person.  But I don't think they would really go along with it. . ."

    "For some reason, I'm still not ready to admit out loud to another person that I'm practically dating another guy.  Even someone who isn't here to judge or hardly even knows me.  It's just a strange concept to me still."

    giamo "If this person cares about you and the relationship that you have, don't you think that they would want to do whatever will make you happy?"

    alex "Yeah, I guess so, but I think it's more complicated than that."

    "He nods and sits back in his chair, folding his fingers in his lap."

    giamo "Am I pushing too hard on this, Alex?  I sense that you have a lot of resistance to this idea, but I'm not sure if it's truly what you want, or if you are concerned about what your partner wants."

    alex "I guess. . .I'm not too sure, either.  It's kind of scary, you know?"

    "He nods empathetically, and I feel like he isn't just humoring me.  His expression says that he understands-I mean, it makes sense, right?"

    giamo "You're right, Alex-a new situation like this can be very scary.  However, I think it might be helpful if we identify just what your fear is."

    alex "What do you mean?"

    giamo "You seem to think that there is some threat to your relationship should you two meet in person, hence your fear.  Are you afraid that he won't be the same person you know in Virtuality?"

    alex "Well I guess it's possible.  I mean, people can change how they look in Virtuality, so maybe they look completely different . . .but that doesn't really matter to me.  But what if he puts on a different personality in Virtuality?  What if he acts totally different?"

    giamo " Alex, I'm going to challenge you a little now, because what you just said doesn't sound like a very rational fear to me.  I don't want you to think that I'm disregarding you, but it's important to separate fears that could come true from the ones that probably won't happen. While it is possible for one to change their looks and personality in Virtuality, big changes like the ones you're concerned about are incredibly rare and extremely difficult.  Virtuality feels like a very real place to us, and while it's easy to make small adjustments and idealizations of ourselves, simply becoming another person is a very difficult task-one that only someone with, say, a dissociative identity disorder, or intensive training could pull off.  Again, Alex, I can't possibly communicate just how unlikely this is what your partner is doing."

    "I can't really argue with logic like that. "

    alex "I guess you're right. . . But even if it wasn't a big change it would still be scary.  I mean, I like who he is now; I don't want him to suddenly be different, even if it's in a subtle way."

    "Dr. Giamo nods in a sympathetic way."

    giamo "Of course.  You're in a comfortable place with things the way they are now, so you're afraid of the changes that it could impose on your relationship.  That's a very reasonable fear, Alex.  But do you really want to let a fear like this direct your actions?"

    alex "It definitely doesn't sound good, but what will I really gain from meeting him in the real world?"

    giamo "Well, for one thing you'll get confirmation that this person is who they say they are.  But wouldn't the opportunity to experience your relationship in reality be valuable to your relationship?"

    alex "I. . . guess it might.  But won't everything just feel the same?  Virtuality is great because it all feels like the real deal.  So what's the difference?"

    giamo "Well I guess much of it is up to your own perceptions.  I'm sure Virtuality is not yet at the point where it can replicate every human sensation to the fullest. . .but I feel that trying to convince of that is not what I should be aiming for, here.  But let me pose a question to you:  If you plan to have a long-term relationship with this person, perhaps even take it to a more permanent level of commitment, would you be all right with never meeting in reality?  Don't answer immediately, just think for a moment."

    "My gut reaction is of course it would be fine-Virtuality is practically the same thing.  Our experiences together already are genuine.  But another part of me nags.  To never truly meet-to never lay eyes on his real face, have his real voice sounding through my ears, or feel his real touch. . .maybe I am missing something."

    alex "I guess. . .I really would like to meet him."

    "Whoops, I slipped.  He seems to take notice, but doesn't look bothered."

    giamo "But there is still that fear, I'm sure."

    alex "Yes, there is.  I just don't know if it's worth the risk."

    giamo "Well, much of that is up to you.  I can't arrange things for the two of you or cut you off from Virtuality so that you have to.  I can only tell you that letting your fear hold you back from what you want will only have negative effects on you and your relationship.  It's likely that desire won't just go away if you truly mean it; you can try to stamp it down, but it will eat away at you from inside over time.  And if you can never be truly satisfied in your relationship unless you've met face-to-face, it will create strife between the two of you.  Everything is in your hands right now, Alex.  You have to make the decision to let go of this fear and reach for what you want.  And you have to want to make this decision."

    alex "I understand.  But what do I do if he says no?"

    giamo "Well that will have to be something that is worked out between the two of you.  But if it's something  that you struggle with, we can always talk about it in another session. . .That is, if you're interested in coming back at all."

    alex " I'll, uh. . .I'll think about it."

    giamo "I hope that this was helpful to you.  I know you came in here with a mindset that was strongly against what I had to say, but you've been very receptive thus far, and I thank you for that.  I hope you understand that I'm not trying to pull you away from what makes you happy, but just help you find other ways to enjoy those things, possibly."

    "He really does seem to be concerned about me.  I wonder if it's genuine, or just some face that therapists have to put on for all of their patients."

    alex "I guess it wasn't that bad."

    "Actually, it was pretty okay, but like I could really admit to that.  He seems to understand, though."

    giamo "In any case, I would also recommend trying to reach out to your mother more, if she was concerned about you in the first place.  Are you two close?  Have you introduced her to the person you're dating yet?"

    alex "No, I guess we haven't really talked about it."

    "For good reason, though. . ."

    giamo "You might consider doing so, if you're comfortable with that idea.  If she has a better idea of the circumstances of your life, she might worry less."

    alex "I guess I have been a little too wrapped up in things to really keep in touch with her. . ."

    "I suddenly am feeling a bit guilty.  Of course she's been freaking out.  She has no idea what's going on with me. . ."

    giamo " I think your mother would understand if she knew that you had a budding relationship going.  After all, I'm sure she still remembers what it's like to be in love."

    "Thanks, but I really don't want to think about that. . ."

    giamo "In any case, I would recommend that you at least think about letting your mother in on your relationship, even if you don't introduce the two of them just yet."

    alex "Yeah, um, I'll try that."

    "I smile awkwardly and he stands, signaling that it's time to conclude our appointment."

    giamo "Well for an introductory appointment, I feel that we sure have covered a lot of ground already.  If you decide that you would like to continue making appointments, just get in touch with the office and they'll set one up for you. "

    alex "Great, thanks. "

    "I probably sound a bit dazed, but I really did mean it.  There was just so much on my mind right now, but it all boils down to just one thing, one question circling through my thoughts; I've decided already:  I want to see the real him-I'm going to try . . . but how-how in the world do I ask him that?"

    #TODO [scene change]"

    mom "Hi, Alex.  It's so good to hear from you –and to be the one that's being called for once."

    alex "Yeah, um, sorry about that before.  I should have been quicker to return your calls.  I hope you weren't worrying too much about me."

    mom "Well I'm your mother, of course I'm going to worry, that's my job! I worry every time you're out of my sight-but anyway, you called for a reason.  What's going on, sweetie?"

    mom "Oh, did you?  I'm so glad you went.  Did it go well?  I hope you didn't hate it."

    "She grimaces a little and I'm guessing there's a bit of \"I'm sorry for making you go, please don't hate me\"in there."

    alex "No, no. . .it was actually. . .it was actually kind of nice."

    mom "Do you want to talk about it?  Is that okay?  Or would you rather keep it between you and him?"

    alex "No, that's actually the reason I called.  I'm sorry we haven't been talking much lately, mom, and that's probably the reason you think I have kind of an addiction to Virtuality."

    mom "Oh, so. . .the doctor didn't think so?"

    alex "Well, we both concluded that I'm definitely using Virtuality more than the average person, but it's not without good reason-or at least that's what I think."

    mom "So, come on-what's she like?   What do you two do together?"

Instead, I prepare myself to say the one thing I've been dreading; but I know I can't hold back on it or it will just create more trouble for me later.  Better to just get it out now. . ."

    mom "Oh, for Pete's sake, Alex-just spit it out.  What is she, a three-eyed monster?"

    alex "No, she's a. . .a he."

    "She takes a small breath and I cannot tell if it is a gasp or just an unconscious pause while she takes in the news.  I don't have to worry about it for long, however, because a smile quickly spreads across her face."

    mom "Oh, Alex, you were worried about telling me that?  I don't care who it is you love as long as you're happy.  Did you really think I'd be upset?"

    alex "No, I guess it's still just a little weird to me, even."

    mom "Well, just as long as you aren't afraid of me.  So you're happy, then?  Sorry I kind of made an assumption there, it's just. . ."

    alex "Yeah, I know, I wouldn't have expected it either mom, trust me.  And yeah, I'm happy."

    mom "So what's he like?"

    alex "Well, he's. . ."

    "How do I describe him?  Until now it's almost like he just exists in my world.  But now. . .now he's becoming involved in the whole circle of people around me."

    alex ". . .He's really intelligent and witty, and he's kind of refined in his tastes but also very open and friendly.  Oh, and he really loves sweets.  Honestly, Mom, I think he's got more of a sweet-tooth than you do."

    mom "Wow, that's quite an accomplishment!  So what does he do?  How did you meet him?  Is he cute?"

    "It's a relief to hear how excited she is, but she goes a little overboard being happy for me.  The questioning goes on like this for some time.  She wants to be up to date on everything and for the most part I'm happy to include her.  It's actually kind of nice sharing all this with someone even if it's unusual territory.  It makes me feel less like this relationship of ours isn't just something I made up in my head."

    "I'm conscious that I'm holding back a little sometimes, and that there are other times when I just don't know how to answer it.  I guess when it comes down to it, I don't know all that much about him.  Not as much as I'd like to know, anyway.  But we're just getting started, so that's okay.  It's still a little awkward saying it all to my mother though."

    "But other things are more difficult.  Like. . .how did our relationship start?  I kind of glaze over that one.  I mean, he's technically also my boss, and before that he was an obsession.  He's an obsession now too, but of a different variety.  I can't really say what level our relationship is at either.  I don't really think I can say he's my boyfriend yet, even if I feel that way about him."

    "We talk for awhile on that subject, but our conversation quickly loses steam.  Mom's happy, though-I can tell she's actually relieved more than anything.  That's one worry off my list."

    alex "So, uh, mom, how's Dad doing?"

    mom "Oh, everything is fine with him.  I don't want to jinx it, but I think he's in the clear right now.  He's been watching what he eats and get this-he's even been exercising.  It isn't much, but it's more than what he was doing before."

    alex "Which was nothing?"

    mom "Well, yeah."

    "She chuckles lightheartedly.  I'm glad to see her sounding more like herself again."

    mom "I think we're both trying to be a bit on the healthier side now.  Anyway-would you like me to put him on?  He's just in the other room."

    alex "No, that's okay, Mom.  I'll talk to him sometime soon though."

    mom "Is it okay if I share the good news with him?"

    alex "Yes, you can.  Actually, I think you'll have an easier time of it than I would."

    mom "Oh, he won't have any problems with it.  I'm sure he'll probably be a bit surprised, but he'll get used to the idea.  And I'm sure he'll be happy for the both of you.  Speaking of. . .do I get to meet this nice young man sometime soon?"

    alex "Well I'll see what I can do, Mom, but he told me he's actually going to be pretty busy for awhile soon.  Even I won't be able to see him."

    mom "Well whenever you both have some free time. . ."

    alex "Sure, Mom, I'll try and work something out."

    mom "And promise me that you'll keep calling?  It really is nice to hear from you.  I'm glad that you're getting along fine on your own, but sometimes I can't help but miss the days when you were practically glued to my hip, always following me around the house on those wobbly legs of yours."

    "I could practically see all the nostalgia rising to the surface.  She started grabbing for a tissue-my mother did always cry easy."

    alex "I miss you too, Mom.  I promise that sometime soon I'll find the time to visit you for real.  I'm sorry I'm not really knee-height anymore, but I hope you'll enjoy having me around just as much now that I'm full-grown."

    mom "Oh, of course.  I would love to see you, and your father would too."

    "She smiles through a slight layer of tears."

    mom "But you know now that you've told me this I'm going to keep pestering  you until you make it over."

    alex "I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Mom."

    mom "Well I'm sure you want to go have a visit with that boyfriend of yours or something, so I'll let you go for now, dear.  Love you!"

She puts my dad on for a few minutes and we chat about nothing in particular.  He does look a lot better, and I'm glad for that.  Of course, now that means I have that much more time to worry and stress over my own problems.   They seem happy at least, though, and that's good."

I went at first just to make her feel better, but the guy I saw. . .well, you came up and he made some really good points.  I don't want there to feel like there are so many secretive parts of our relationship.  I just want it to be you and me and nothing between us.  I want to get to know the real you."

    alex "You've got to have some sort of idea how you feel about it.  I mean, do you not want to see the real me?  Would that really do nothing for you?  Is it really all the same to you?"

    silver "Yes, Alex, as I just said Virtuality is real.  Whatever else is out there is just another reality to me-it's all equal.  But either way, I don't think you understand that what you're requesting is not a simple thing."

    alex "What's so complicated about it?  We meet and then we do all the things we do in Virtuality."

    silver "Alex, please, you don't understand."

    "He's got one hand pressed to the side of his face and won't look me in the eyes. "

    alex "Then tell me about it so I can."

    silver "Look, Alex, another time, okay?  I just need time to think on it all on my own time.  It's just overwhelming-I wasn't expecting this at all.  Can't we just. . .hit the pause button on all this for a little while and then pick it back up later?"

    "That's the last thing I want to do.  What I want is an answer right now, and I want it to be \"yes\".  I just wish we could do it all now.  But I know I have to be sensitive to his feeling, too."

    alex " All right.  But promise me that you'll think about it-and really think about it. "

    silver "I promise.  And I also promise that I really don't hate the idea of it, either.  It's just more complicated than you realize."

    alex "I wish you'd tell me what that means."

    silver "We're pausing this for now, remember?-now let's just enjoy a nice evening together."

    "Teasingly, he grabs a hold of my collar and pulls me close to him.  And as he pulls me he leans back so that I end up almost on top of him.  We're nose-to-nose now.  I feel his arms reach up and wrap around my back, holding me tight against him.  We're so close to each other, yet we aren't kissing.  We're just holding each other, and it's nice.  It's warm and it's comfortable, and it's the sort of thing that I could just melt into and stay there for a long time.  His hands move slowly up and down my back, caressing it, and I place my head in the little niche between his shoulder and his neck."

    "One of his hands moves up my neck, brushes through my hair, and comes to rest on the back of my head, cradling it.  We fit together so perfectly that it just seems impossible.  It should have been cramped and uncomfortable, but it wasn't.  I've got to be just making all this up, right?  I've never felt so comfortable and at ease in my entire life.  Every inch of me just feels. . .relaxed."

    "Things go back to normal for awhile.  We just watch one of his shows all cuddled up; our new usual.  Everything is fine until I notice him seeming a little distracted.  A little frown crosses his face."

    alex "Is everything okay?  You seem like you're thinking about something else."

    silver "Yeah. . . I was just remembering something I haven't told you about yet."

    "He pauses the show and rolls over onto his back, staring upward."

    alex "Well geez, now you're making me worry with that look on your face.  Is it that bad?"

    silver "No, it's not bad, per se, just. . .unfortunate."

    alex "Whatever it is, could you just tell me already?  You're freaking me out here."

    silver "I'm going to be a bit, er, preoccupied soon.  Something important is coming up for me and I'll need to give it my fullest attention."

    alex "Oh, geez, is that all?  You really had me freaking out!"

    "I'm relieved at first but then an unhappy thought runs through my head-one I just thought of: maybe I scared him off with all my talk of meeting in person.  What if this is just his way of putting some distance between us?"

    silver "Well I just wanted you to know that I won't have all this free time like normal.  In fact, I won't have time for our experiments either during this time.  O-oh, but don't worry, you'll still get paid during that time."

    "He seems genuine, so I try to brush off what was probably irrational thinking."

    alex "Well that's good, I guess.  What are you going away for, though?"

    silver "I'm afraid it's something I can't really discuss it at the moment. "

    "I raise an eyebrow at this."

    alex "Not even a little?"

    silver "Sorry, it's very sensitive information at the moment; besides it's a difficult matter that I'd really rather not discuss anyway.  I just wanted to give you a bit of a heads up so my disappearance would not take you by surprise."

    "The worry crops up again, but I try to tamp it down."

    alex "How long do you think you'll be gone for?"

    silver "I'm not really sure about that either.  I really know very little at this point."

    "Silence passes between us.  I'm still worrying a little.  I decide to bite the bullet and just ask."

    alex "Hey, silly question, but this isn't at all related to what I asked about earlier, was it?  Was I too pushy?"

    "He seems genuinely surprised by this question and pulls me close to him."

    silver "No, you silly.  I would never try to avoid you for something like that.  That is just not something I can consider right now is all.  We will talk about it some other time.  But it has nothing to do with why I'm going away, I promise."

    "He wraps his arms around me and pulls me tight to him, resting his head against my chest.  He seems ready to be done talking about it."

    "It definitely sounds a little fishy to me, but these things are par for the course with him.  I want to be convinced that it isn't related to something I did, but I can't help but still have a small nagging feeling that spoke to the contrary.  I shove all that down for the moment and tell myself that everything will be fine; it's important that I enjoy my time with him right now instead of worrying about it."

    "In a few seconds he slides down so that his head is laying on my lap and his legs are propped up over the end of the couch."

    silver "Don't worry; I'll try not to be gone for too long.  After all, I'll be missing my favorite spot to fall asleep on."

    "He teasingly turns over and does a mock snoring sound for several seconds and then rolls back over with a wide grin on his face."

    "I run a hand through his hair, stroking it into place, and trace the line of his jaw with my figure.  I really am going to miss this while he's gone, but I try to smile anyway.  He really wants me to feel okay about this; he's probably been holding this back the entire night, trying to find the right time to break it to me. "

    "I don't like that we still have secrets that we each keep from each other; it creates a palpable feeling of distance between us.  But I'm not ready to explain everything that's going on with me just yet, so I'll just have to live with it."

    "He's beaming up at me from my lap now, reaching up to touch my face.  I try to put all this business out of my mind and just enjoy this moment."

    "There's still one question nagging at me-\"What are we?\"; is this all just a game, are we using each other in order to be happy, or is this something real, something meant to last?"

    "The question is on the tip of my tongue this time, but he steals it from me with a sudden kiss that pulls me down on top of him.  Our bodies are pressed together with no space left between them; the kiss becomes forceful and full of need.  His hands reach around to my back, teasingly running up underneath my shirt, lifting it.  His touch feels almost electric from the way my body reacts to it.  I break the kiss only to take a few playful nips at his neck.  The sharp, pleasure-filled breath that he takes is a beautiful sound that I cannot get enough of.  His hands continue to explore my body, working their way up my back, tracing the lines of each muscle and gripping hard when I do something right."

    "The notion that we could go further hangs in the air between our frantic kisses.  His hands are eager to remove every article of clothing from my body; to have complete access to each other's body with no barriers in between. . .I want it to, but there's still fear there.  This is still new to me."

    "I falter when his hands start to drift lower down to the button on my pants.  He immediately senses that this alarms me and backs off, placing his hands around my face instead.  He looks up at me with understanding eyes and pulls me back into another tidal wave of intense kisses."

    "My question is forgotten; all I can think about is the endless meeting of our lips, the small breaths he is taking, and the light touch of his fingers as he runs them through the hair on the back of my head.  I shudder.  Nothing else matters."

    #TODO [scene change]"

    "I'm sitting in Dr. Giamo's office once again, shuffling my feet uncomfortably as I wait for him to take his seat across from me.  He's at his desk right now, reviewing his notes from our last session before we begin."

    "Never thought I'd end up here again.  But. . ."

    "It's been almost a week since Silver Phoenix and I discussed meeting in real life and him leaving, and I had found myself wanting for someone to talk to that wasn't my mother and  would be unlikely to judge me.  I found myself making an appointment with him without even giving it much thought."

    "Finally, Dr. Giamo puts away the papers and settles into the chair across from me."

    giamo "It's good to see you again, Alex.  I was pleasantly surprised to see you decided to make another appointment with me." 

    alex "I'm a little surprised too, to be honest."

    "I start to wonder if this was perhaps a bad idea, but I can't find a single legitimate feeling inside of me to support that, and so the thought is quickly hushed."

    giamo "Well the fact that you're here must mean that you want to talk about something.  Unless you're here at the request of your mother again. . .? "

    alex "No, no this was. . .this was all me this time.  But my mother and I did talk, and she seems a lot happier now that she knows more about what's going on in my life."

    giamo "That's great, Alex.  I would imagine that's also a huge relief for you also, right?"

    "I nod enthusiastically."

    alex "Yeah.  I'll, uh, have to make sure that we keep talking."

    giamo "Good, Good.  So what else brings you here today, Alex?  Did you have a chance to discuss meeting with your partner in reality?"

    alex "Yeah, we talked about it a little."

    giamo "And how did that go?"

    "My right hand clenches a little."

    alex "I'm not sure.  I didn't really get the reaction I was expecting from him.  I'm still not really sure how he feels about it."

    giamo "Why don't you describe to me how the conversation went.  Maybe I can help."

    alex "Well I asked him. . .And he didn't exactly say no, but it definitely wasn't a yes.  He kept saying things like how \"complicated\" it would be, and that it wouldn't be an easy thing.  He said we'd talk about it some other time."

    giamo "Did you two set aside another time to talk about it?  Maybe he just needed a bit of time to think."

    alex "We didn't, no.  Not long after he told me that he'd be going away pretty soon and would be busy for a little while."

    giamo "That seems like it upsets you."

    "Was it that plain on my face?"

    alex "I'm worried that I freaked him out a little by asking.  Maybe he's trying to distance himself from me."

    giamo "Do you have any evidence to support that?"

    alex "I guess not.  I mean, it was a little sudden and the timing was kind of suspicious, but I guess that isn't really hard evidence."

    giamo "Well, what about evidence against it.  Is this something that would fit his personality?"

    "Immediately, the day when he first kissed me comes to mind, and I try not to blush.  He always seems to be up front about his feelings. . . "

    alex "I guess it would be a little out of character for him."

    "Dr. Giamo nods as if I'd said exactly what he expected to hear."

    giamo "Is there anything else?"

    alex "Well I did ask him if that was the reason he was leaving and he said no. . .I don't really picture him lying to me to cover up how he feels. . ."

    giamo "Then perhaps it's simply a case of bad timing?  Would it be possible for you to think of it under that logic?  I feel it might bring you some peace of mind."

    alex "I'll try."

    "Dr. Giamo gives a wry smile."

    giamo "That wasn't very convincing, Alex.  But I understand that this isn't an easy task.  I think we talked a bit about fear in your last visit and how it can take an unfortunate control of your life.  I would suggest reminding yourself of all the things that would discredit this fear.  Maybe you still believe that fear could come true right now, but perhaps if you say these things to yourself often enough it will start to seem less real."

    "I nod without saying anything.  What he says makes a  lot of sense, but he's right to say that it isn't easy."

    "Our session continues for a little bit longer, but nothing of much importance is discussed.  He seems interested in getting to know me better in a case I keep coming.  We talk a little bit more about my relationship, but on a simpler level.  After awhile, he points out the time and suggests that we will have to wrap up this session."

    giamo "Keep thinking positively, Alex.  And if you find that your worries are getting stronger, I hope that you find yourself able to sit down and discuss this with your partner, and that you trust that he will tell you the truth about how he feels.  I'm here for you too, if you feel you need someone else to talk to-just call the office and make an appointment and we'll see where we can squeeze you in.  Okay, Alex?"

    alex "Great, thank you."

    "I step out of Dr. Giamo's office balancing on a mental seesaw.  I want to believe that he wouldn't just run away from me like that; that it's a legitimate task that he's leaving for.  I try to put away all the insecurity and trust in him.  And for the most part, I'm successful, but that little seed of worry has already been planted.  It's buried underground now, where I can mostly forget about it, but if something helps it to sprout. . ."

    "Well. . ."

    "I try not to think about it.  Think positively, right? "

    #TODO [scene change- Alex's room]"

    "I yawn and stretch back in my desk chair, stretching away from the w,indow of information in front of me.  I haven't really done anything of importance today-it's technically a day off for me, and I find that I don't really know how to spend them when I'm on my own anymore.  I focused so long on catching up to Silver Phoenix that I sort of lost track of all my other hobbies.  I used to read a lot, but now I find that I don't have the patience for anything longer than a news article anymore.  I guess that's the downside to forcing myself into such a fast-paced and busy lifestyle for so long-I don't really know how to slow down anymore."

    "I haven't really been fighting in the arena since I quit the tournaments.  I consider going down for some practice-just to blow off some steam, but quickly renounce the idea; my face and name are still pretty well known.  It's been awhile since I quit, but I hear that there are still some groups of fans holding onto the hope that I'm just on a vacation or something.  I'm not really in the mood for all that right now."

    "I realize that I just want to spend some time with Silver Phoenix.  It seems like that's all I ever want anymore. . .but it's nice not being alone.  I'd rather share the time with the person I care about most."

    "I'm certain that he's just hanging out in his office, doing whatever it is he does when I'm not there; but it never seems to matter what he's engaged with-he's always happy to put it away and spend the time with me. In fact, he almost seems relieved to see me; as if I'm the only legitimate excuse he has to stop working."

    "It's decided then-I'm going to go visit him."

    "I connect to his office and prepare to teleport over there."

    "I'm immediately met with a curt and unexpected error.  I'm not permitted entry-It seems he's not there."

    "That's odd.  He's always there around this time.  He could have stepped out for a few minutes, though.  I guess this was bound to happen at some point, right?  I mean, I know he isn't in his office all the time.  That'd be ridiculous."

    "I drop the idea for now.  I'll give it a little bit and try again."

    "But now I'm back to my original conundrum-what should I do?"

    "I guess a walk would do nicely.  There's always something interesting to see in Virtuality, even just by wandering around.  Things change around here a lot more than they do in the real world, and in much more fantastic ways. As long as I don't wander too close to the arena I should be okay."

    "I head out of my office, trying to ignore the tiniest bit of unease that had wormed its way into my mind."

    #TODO [scene change – a couple hours later]"

    "I return to my office, feeling satisfied.  Even if I don't miss fighting in the tournaments, being in the office so much makes me feel a bit restless; getting out for awhile was a good way to blow off some steam, even if I didn't really do much but wander."

    avatar "Welcome back.  Would you like me to prepare refreshments for you?"

    "I do feel a bit parched, but I'd rather enjoy some tea with Silver Phoenix-no offense to [avatar_name]."

    alex "That's okay, I'm not staying.  I just wanted to check-in real quick before I left again."

    "She looks a little concerned but only nods in reply."

    alex "Don't worry, I promise I'm taking care of myself."

    "She brightens up a little at this and disappears, wishing me a good evening."

    "Okay, time to get out of here.  He's almost certainly back by now."

    "I start the connection once again, feeling confident, but I am quickly met with another denial of my request to enter.  Still not there. . .?  Or does he not want to be disturbed for some reason?"

    "Feeling confused, I plop down into my desk chair.  It's unusual for him to be unreachable for more than an hour or so.  He's so involved with Virtuality that he's hardly ever gone from it-at least not that I've noticed."

    "I absently start to go through my emails, while chiding myself for being so concerned over such a silly thing.  I'm still pondering the situation when I see a message from him sitting squarely in the list of new emails.  It arrived this afternoon, but I don't check my emails as much as I used to, even though [avatar_name] is diligent in notifying me whenever new ones arrive.  Stupid. "

    "I open up the message:"

    "Alex-Sorry if this is a bit sudden, but I had to leave today for what we discussed before.  I'll see you when I get back.   Missing you already."

    "I stare at the message for a long time.  It's a bit curt, almost as though he was rushed in writing it.  I'm disappointed; I guess I didn't realize that he would be leaving so soon.  Well that's that, I guess.  There's not much I can do."

    "I type out a quick reply to his message-nothing special, just well wishes for whatever it was he was doing, and a few teasing remarks about how much I missed him and all the things we'd do when he got back.  I try to keep myself from rambling on too long and send it off before I can make a complete fool of myself."

    "Once it's sent, I sit back in my chair and sigh.  Well what now?  I won't deny that I already feel the loneliness setting in.  I don't visit him every day, so I'm used to spending time apart from him, but not having that option open to me feels very strange."

    "What to do. . .what to do?"

    "I finally decide to call [avatar_name] back in to the room."

    avatar "I thought you were leaving, sir.  Did I misunderstand?"

    alex "No, I, uh-I had a change in plans.  I'm hanging out here tonight."

    "She seems genuinely pleased at this revelation."

    avatar "Oh!  Would you like me to prepare some refre-"

    alex " --That's okay, really.  I called you in here because I was hoping we could just chat or something."

    "The AI technology we have now should be capable of holding an extended conversation, right?  I guess I'll find out."

    avatar "What would you like to talk about , Alex?  Would you like me to review your recent health status reports with you?"

    alex "No, nothing like that.  I just want to talk-you know, like people do."

    avatar "We could discuss current world events.  That is a common discussion topic."

    alex "Okay, sure.  Anything's fine, I guess."

    "I just want something to fill the silence.  We start out talking about politics, a subject which I have perhaps only slightly more knowledge of than the average person; it quickly becomes clear though, that when talking to an AI with a near encyclopedic knowledge of everything going on in the world-every news article and piece of media-it's very easy to fall behind in the conversation.  In fact, it quickly becomes more like listening to a news broadcast, straight with her quoting news articles that I remember reading already."

    "I try to switch the topic of conversation to something a little more casual, but I don't really stand a chance there either.  On a normal night I might have found it endearing, but I really wasn't in the mood for such a stark contrast with what I normally have with Silver Phoenix; before too long, I give up on the idea entirely."

    "I check my messages, hoping to see a reply from Silver Phoenix, but there is nothing.  He said he'd be busy, I remind myself, but it's not a comfort.  I decide to call it a night and try to cheer myself up with the thought that I'll probably have a sweet little message from him waiting for me in the morning."

    #TODO [scene change]

    "I stare at the rows of new messages, thinking that somehow there has to be a mistake; there's nothing from him-no reply at all.  It's been 24 hours since I replied to his message and still nothing back from him. . ."

    "Maybe I'm obsessing a little, but I'm really starting to worry.  Was he travelling somewhere?  What if something happened, like his plane crashed?  I wish he had given me a better idea of what he was doing. . .it would be a lot easier to picture him safe if I at least knew where he was."

    "I've been trying not to think about it too much, just checking my messages every so often and otherwise trying to keep myself busy, but the worry was really creeping up on me now.  Should I try calling him?  No. . .it's still too early to really freak out.  He's probably still getting settled and just hasn't had a minute to catch up with me.  I start to believe this comforting thought, but soon a little voice inside of me sees this as an opportune time to speak up.  It brings back the fear that he might be avoiding me because I upset him."

    "No, no, no-I can't.  I'll drive myself crazy if I keep going on like this.  This is insane.  He's fine.  Everything is fine.  I'm stressing myself out over nothing, like usual.  It's because I have nothing to engross myself in.  My mind is idle and so I have so much more time to worry."

    "Maybe. . .Maybe I'll get myself into the habit of reading again.  There have been some new books out recently that sounded pretty interesting.  I think I'll try one of those; throwing myself into some epic fantasy novel should do the trick."

    #TODO [scene change – two days later] "

    "I put down the second book in the series I started the other day; it was somewhat of a mistake to pick this series because it turned out to be about a fugitive mage in a kingdom where magic is outlawed.  All I can think about while I read it is my mage. I don't even remember what the main character is supposed to look like, because I've replaced him with the Silver Phoenix in my head. I should have just put it down and found something else when I realized how depressing it would be, but it's sadly the best distraction I've had since he left."

    "There are still no messages for me-at least none from the person I want to hear from most.  I'm really starting to worry now.  It's got to be justified at this point, right?  I haven't heard a peep from him in days. . .that just isn't right.  Something might be wrong."

    "I'm halfway through the second book now, and I suddenly find myself having to reread paragraphs over and over because I can't focus.  I should call him.  Even if he can't really talk, just to hear his voice and to know that he's okay is all I need. . .I don't care if he yells at me and tells me he's too busy for me, I've just got to give it a shot."

    "Yes. . ."

    "It'll finally settle this once and for all.  He'll pick up and we'll both have a laugh at my silliness and that'll be that.  I'll be totally fine no matter how much longer he's away.  I just need to know that he's okay now and then everything can be all right again. "

    "I settle down at my desk and start the call, smiling as I think of what his bemused might look like when he picks it up. "

    "It rings. . "

    "And rings. . ."

    "And rings. . ."

    "Until finally I hear his voice-but much to my disappointment it's only a recording urging me to leave a message.  I'm starting to feel a cold fear now.  Something has got to be wrong.  It just has to be."

    "But what can I do?"

    "I'm not going to just spam him with messages.  I'm not.  Because then if it turns out that everything is okay #(which will probably be the case) I'll just look like a crazy person.  I need to control my fears.  Think rationally.  Keep distracting myself.  He'll come back to me eventually, and everything will be fine.  I just have to be patient."

    "But damn it, why can't he at least give me some sort of sign that he's okay?  Geez, that jerk."

    "The more I think about it, the more I realize that there's just so much about him that I don't know.  I don't know his real name or where he's from, or even how hold he is.   I don't know if he has any health conditions that could be agitated by stress, or if he's a sleepwalker or has some childhood respiratory disease.  Hell, I don't even know what he's doing right now that's keeping him from contacting me."

    "What am I doing?"

    "Before he left I felt like I knew everything there was to know about him, but now, when I can't even contact him, I feel like I know absolutely nothing.  But right now, all I want to know-all that matters for me to know-is that he's okay."

    "Maybe. . .maybe I should make an appointment with Dr. Giamo. If I can just listen to him talk for awhile in those calming tones. . .he'll tell me that everything will be okay-that it's irrational to think that just because I can't get into contact with him that doesn't mean something terrible has happened.  I know all these things, but hearing it from somebody else would make it more believable.  Yeah.  That sounds perfect."

    "I make a call to his office and request an appointment.  The receptionist fumbles for a minute while she looks for an empty appointment slot.  When she finally succeeds, she comes back sounding very apologetic as she tells me that the next available slot is almost two weeks from now.  If Silver Phoenix isn't back by then I probably will have already gone crazy beyond repair. . .but I make the appointment anyway.  It will probably be good to talk about this with Dr. Giamo, even if the matter is long settled before I have the appointment.  Maybe we can find a better way for me to deal with this sort of situation, should it happen again."

    "I'm starting to calm down a little, even if nothing was accomplished.  I just need some distance from the whole situation.  I consider calling my parents for a chat, but I'm sure my mother would just want to press me for more information about Silver Phoenix. . .and that really wouldn't be good for me."

    "I decide to step out of the office for awhile with no set destination in mind and no plans to return until several hours have passed."

    alex "Why didn't you get in contact with me?  I've been worried sick over you!"

    silver "Dead?  Alex, I just away for a few days. . .Just because I'm out of your sight doesn't mean a tragedy will happen."

    alex "Yeah, well normal people will at least have a moment to pick up the phone."

    silver "I really am sorry, Alex.  I wanted to call you, but I was busy just about every minute of the day-I didn't even check any of my personal messages until I got back, and then I came straight to you.  I wanted to call you at night, but it was always much too late and I didn't wish to wake you, and I honestly couldn't even keep myself awake long enough to send you a message."

    "He really does look apologetic.  Maybe I'm being a little too harsh, but I really was scared.  I should  be happy that it's over now-that he's back with me, but the stress of it all hasn't dissipated yet."

    silver "It took a lot longer than I thought.  I kept thinking that the next day I would get to come home to you, so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal if I held off on contacting you. . .but things kept coming up to extend my stay.  I did not realize that you would worry after me so much, though.  I suppose you have a right to be angry.  If I had realized I would have made sure to contact you no matter what."

    alex "I was really worried that something had happened to you.  I just kept imagining all the bad things that could have happened. . ."

    "He pulls me close into an all-encompassing hug and the anger starts to melt away.  I'm really am happy to see that he's back safe and sound.  Not knowing was the scariest thing of all. . ."

    silver "I really am sorry that I scared you."

    "He looks so upset-almost as if he's about to start crying."

    alex "It's okay.  I'm just glad you're back."

    "I brush some of his hair back and give him a small kiss on the cheek.  He pulls back a little and we stare directly into each other's eyes for a long time.  He places his hands on the sides of my face and pulls me towards him so that our foreheads touch-gently, this time.  He closes his eyes and breathes in slowly and deep several times."

    silver "The only place that feels like home anymore is wherever you are."

    "I don't really know what to say.  I feel electrified with his touch; it had only been a few days but the sensation felt like new.  Before I know it, we are caught up in a kiss that seems to stretch on into the night.  I missed the smell and the taste of him; I am happy to be smothered in it."

    "When the kiss finally ends, he is lying on top of me.  He lets his head rest on my chest and takes deep breaths, his eyes shut.  If a little more time had passed, I would say that he was probably asleep, he looked so peaceful."

    "My mind is going in so many directions right now.  I want to just enjoy the moment, the simple perfection of having him near, but I know that there are other important things to be discussed."

    alex "Listen, there are some things I want to talk about with you. "

    silver " Of course, Alex.  I would be happy to discuss these things, whatever they may be, but can it wait until tomorrow?  I'm exhausted-I haven't had a good night's sleep since I left.  I promise we will have a rousing discussion of anything and everything you desire after I have rested."

    "He's talking in a comically drawn out voice.  I'm not sure if he's trying to exaggerate how tired he is for my benefit, or if he really is that exhausted."

    alex "Okay, that's fair."

    "I plant a quick kiss on the top of his head.  These things can wait.  I start to sit up, expecting him to want to leave and go get some rest, but he resists this action, making himself an immovable weight that holds me down."

    silver "Can I please stay here with you tonight?  I don't think I have the energy to move right now, and I'm really really comfy right here.  I really did miss you.  I hated not having the time to talk to you.  But even if I did, it would never compare to this."

    alex "You don't have to plead your case; you're more than welcome to stay.  In fact, I'd really like it if you would."

    "I pull him close to me, and he smiles dreamily.  It isn't long before he really has fallen asleep, leaving me to my thoughts for only a few minutes before I follow him."

    #TODO [scene change – next day]"

    alex "Geez, I can't believe it's already 1 o'clock."

    silver "What, do you have a hot date or something to get ready for?"

    "He grins tosses me the rest of my clothes, patting his own dutifully back into place. Moments ago, everything had been thrown in a careless pile on the floor."

    alex "Well I'm sure that you probably have some things you need to catch up on after being gone so long. . ."

    "I say this a little sadly.  I know we can't be around each other all the time, but I really don't want to see him leave."

    silver "Well, I've got a little time yet.  Besides, wasn't there something  you wanted to talk about?"

    alex "Yeah.  I. . .well, it's stupid, but I was really worried that whole time that you were gone and I couldn't get in contact with you."

    silver "I surmised as much from your reaction last night.  I know it doesn't make up for it, but I really am sorry."

    alex " I know you are, and I'm not trying to make you feel guilty for it.  But you've got a lot of things going on in your life it seems.  I'm sure that something like this is going to happen again, and I don't really want to go through all the worry of not knowing whether you're okay or not."

    "He nods thoughtfully and looks away for a moment as though thinking deeply."

    alex "I mean. . .don't you worry about me, too?"

    silver "I do worry about you, Alex.  Perhaps I have never quite felt the same fear you felt for me these past few days, but I understand your worry.  I don't know what I would do if something happened to you.  But. . ."

    "Perhaps I have a solution.  Or at the very least, something that will help.  I would like to officially give you access to the information collected on my vital signs."

    alex "Isn't that usually just for alerting hospitals if there's a problem?"

    silver "Yes, but you can also enable others that you're close with to view these things as well.  I don't suspect that there will be any problems, but I thought it might at least be a comfort to you."

    alex "I'd like that."

    silver "It's just basic information you know, like heartbeat and body temperature, but at least you'll be able to know that I'm all right.  And, if it's all right, I'd like to ask the same from you."

    alex "Of course!  I'd really like that, too."

    "We take a brief moment to set all this up through a sort of app.  It's surprisingly easy.  People used to get upset about all the different kinds of data being collected on us all the time, but things like this really do come in handy."

    "I pull up his information as a test, and in an instant it's all right there in front of me.  I see a simple interface with a set of numbers and visual representations of his heartbeat and breathing; there are even accompanying sound effects."

    "I look away from this data and look up at him.  He smiles, and I hear his heart rate suddenly pick up just a tiny bit.  He blushes as this happens and I put the app away for now."

    silver "All better?"

    alex " This is perfect.  But. . .you really don't mind me having all this information?"

    silver "If you can find comfort in it, then of course not."

    "He reaches over and plays with the hair on the back of my head a little, sending a delightful shiver up my spine."

    silver "Now, then-there really are a few things I must take care of back at the office."

    "I can't help but pout a little when he says this."

    silver ". . .But why don't you come over in a few hours, hmm?  We can't let our research lapse for too long after all, right?"

    alex "Oh, yeah, of course."

    "I don't really care what we're doing, as long as we can spend some time together."

    silver "And perhaps later we can try a few other types of experiments as well."

    "He brushes my neck with his fingers and grins mischievously, leaving me speechless.  He doesn't wait for me to find my words, and quickly exits my office, leaving me with that thought."

    "I sigh wistfully and try to rid myself of the sensation of butterflies in my stomach.  It feels good to have him back-like everything is right again.  I worry that maybe I'm getting too attached too quickly.  Things could always go wrong; there will likely be issues between us down the line-things we fight about and things we hate about each other.  I try to remind myself that things won't be so perfect and easy between us for long, and that I should get used to having at least some amount of distance from him, if only so that I'm not a complete wreck whenever he's gone.  But all that sensibility just feels like I'm trying to ruin all the good things I have now.  It's wonderful and I should be enjoying it without all the \"but's\" and \"what if's\"."

    "We still have to talk about meeting in person, though.  I was too happy to have him back to want to ruin the moment with that sort of talk, but I think later on today will be a good time."

    "For now, I just relax.  It's the first time I've been able to relax in days without him being here.  I pick up that book I had been reading and find that I am finally able to picture what the mage in the book is supposed to look like, and not just Silver Phoenix's face.  Everything seems back to normal again.  Finally."

    #TODO [scene change-later]"

    alex "Ow, hey, calm down there, Toffee!"

    "I gently shake off the fairy-tale giraffe-creature that's pawing at my leg for attention since I dared to ignore it for a few seconds."

    silver "Oh, don't act so put-off, we both know you like Toffee!  He missed you!"

    alex "Well, yeah. . .  But. . .why does it have to act like a puppy when it's shaped like a giraffe?"

    "I say this as it props itself up on its hind legs to paw at me, but it doesn't reach much further than my shins."

    silver "I don't know.  But my guess is that sort of behavior must have been issued to it by one of us when we created it."

    alex "You think one of us told it to act like a puppy?"

    silver "Not necessarily, no.  It's just an aspect of ourselves that ended up in there.  In any case, it's just a theory.  Do you like dogs, Alex?"

    alex "Yeah, my family used to have a couple.  They're not around anymore, but. . .dogs are pretty okay.  They're friendly and it's fun to see how excited they get over the little things.  What about you?"

    silver "I wasn't raised around dogs.  I've never had any pets to be honest, but I think I would be more partial to cats."

    "Makes sense, considering how much he acts like one at times."

    silver "An Aunt of mine used to have this little dog that I was quite fond of, though.  I guess I hadn't thought about it in a while-it's funny how we forget things sometimes."

    "He looks a little distant all of a sudden.  I think it's best we change the subject."

    alex "So what are we doing today?"

    silver "Well I thought we might continue working with our new little friend, here."

    alex "What else is there to do now that it already exists?"

    silver "At a glance it seems like just a plaything, but I've been keeping a close eye on it and it seems to be exhibiting some intriguing behaviors."

    alex "Like what?"

    silver "Well, it's a bit difficult to describe, but among other things, I've noticed that it seems quite intelligent and seems to understand what's going on around it.  I mean, it's already learned its name, it seems."

    alex "Isn't that pretty typical for AI, though?"

    silver "Well, yes, but since this is a construct created specifically by the two us, I'm curious to know just what sort of patterns the AI follows.  It's not the same as something that was preprogrammed as  a part of Virtuality.  This is something new, something that acts independently, but is still somehow connected to the two of us.  It's in our best interests to learn more."

    "I shrug, not quite following his line of interest on this one, but I was happy to be along for the ride, nonetheless.  We both squat down low to the ground so that we were on the level of our little friend.  I decide to take it a step further and lay down on my stomach, propped up on my elbows.  Toffee immediately nuzzles up to me."

    "Silver Phoenix runs a few simple tests  He wants to see if it can do things like learn, and so he pulls out three cups and a few biscuits.  Once he has the little creature's attention, he lines up the cups and places a biscuit underneath one, and proceeds with the age-old game of switching up the cups to see if the prize can be tracked.  Toffee is to the whole process at the very least.  Silver Phoenix makes only a few switches to keep the game simple, and when he is finished Toffee begins to nudge at the cup it believes hides the intriguing item.  Its guess turns out to be wrong, but Silver Phoenix seems as though this is the outcome he expected.  He resets the field and begins again after revealing the actual location of the treat to the clearly eager creature.  Its little paper wings flutter with excitement and intrigue."

    "As he begins switching the cups, I notice that he is following the same pattern as before, with the cup with the treat ending up in the exact same place as before.  The second guess is also incorrect, and I flash Silver Phoenix a skeptical look.  He returns my look with a \"just wait\" raise of his eyebrows as he shows the actual location of the treat and begins third time."

    "Finally, a correct guess after only a little bit of hesitation and wavering towards one of the wrong cups.  Silver Phoenix hands over the treat and the Toffee takes it without hesitation.  Once munched on, though, the treat doesn't seem to pass into Toffee's translucent body-it simply disappears as though it were never taken.  I would think it odd, but there isn't really anything about Toffee that isn't."

    "Silver Phoenix repeats the experiment a few more times, keeping with the same pattern.  The creature seemingly has caught onto the pattern and guesses right each time now."

    alex "This seems a little mundane, doesn't it?  I mean, if we wanted to, we could probably make a creature that would know which is the right one without any training."

    silver "I'm aware of that, but I'm more interested right now in exploring what we did create rather than what we could."

    alex "I think you just want to play with it."

    "I give him a sly smile and know that I'm at least partly right.  He doesn't try hard to hide it either, and immediately picks up the creature and plops it into his lap, petting the top of its head affectionately."

    "I'm a little jealous."

    "Actually, I'm more than a little jealous.  What I wouldn't give to have him pluck me up like that and lavish me with such affection without a second thought.  Am I really jealous of a silly little translucent giraffe that feels like it's made of glass? "

    "Well, right now I am."

    "He seems to have abandoned the experiment for the moment and continues to pet the ecstatic Toffee while he gazes around the room absentmindedly.  I wonder what it must be like to be that little creature.  Is it even aware of how lucky it is?  It seems happy enough, fluttering its paper wings; the glittery blue liquid that swirled around its insides seemed to be an even more magnificent color than usual.  It truly was an odd creature, but what I wouldn't give to be in its shoes right now."

    "I close my eyes for a moment and rest my chin on my arm, still thinking about the little creature."

    "Suddenly, I feel a hand brush against the top of my head.  I jerk upwards suddenly with a grin, thinking that he must have seen me swimming in my jealousy and decided to share the affection."

    "But to my confusion, he is still sitting in the same place, his hand resting on the Toffee's head.  He glances over me with a serene grin."

    silver "What, did you almost fall asleep?"

    alex "No, I. . ."

    "He gives me an odd look."

    alex "Nothing, I just got a chill or something I guess."

    "He shrugs and continues his thoughtful look around the room.  What was that?  My imagination, I guess. . .Somehow."

    "I close my eyes once more and try to enjoy the peacefulness of the day, despite such an odd feeling.  This was nice, even if we didn't have much to say.  I really do wish that he would lavish some of that attention on me, though.  Even with my eyes closed I can tell that he's still petting the head of the creature, with it probably looking as content as can be."

    "I feel something brush the top of my head again.  I don't immediately react this time, even though it is a difficult instinct to beat.  And again, brushing from the front of my head to the back.  Slowly, I open my eyes, certain that I will see him leaning over me this time."

    "But the sight in front of me is far more confusing.  In fact, it is baffling, but I recognize it immediately:  I am seeing from the perspective of  Toffee-I see and feel the giant arm encapsulating its-my-belly, and the two little glass legs that rest upon it.  There are two folded legs beneath, and another giant hand reaching down every so often to gently brush the top of my head.  I gaze around, and soon find myself gazing into the face of the Silver Phoenix above me.  When I gaze at myself-my actual self-still laying there with head down and eyes shut, the illusion begins to break.  The sights and the feelings begin to fade away, back to my own."

    "I look away.  This is nice.  I should be bothered; I should be freaking out right now, but the comforting grip that he has on me is all I need to stay calm.  I am that I want to stay like this for at least a little while longer."

    silver "Alex?"

    "The sudden sound of my name somehow stuns me, sends the strange vision away.  The feel of his hands around me is gone, just as quickly as it arrived.  I am seeing nothing but the darkness behind my eyelids.  Silver Phoenix calls my name once more and I pick my own head up with a start.  I see him and the dopey little giraffe still sitting there, just the same as before."

    alex "Huh? "

    silver "Alex, I think you really did fall asleep this time."

    "He chuckles as though this is somehow the most amusing thing that could have happened and tosses one of the remaining biscuits into his mouth.  Did I fall asleep?  Was it a dream?  I know that things could sometimes feel and look real in dreams. . .but usually once you've awoken you realize that it didn't actually feel very real at all-And this definitely felt real."

    "There was only one way to find out.  I decide to test it once more, this time with my eyes open.  It was harder to form that sort of connection with my eyes still open, but with some concentrated I find that I able to see through the creature's eyes once more; I can receive feedback from all of its senses, and feel each time his hand comes down and caresses the top of its head.  And how wonderful it feels.  It's difficult to maintain, though, and I soon find myself losing control over it, slipping back to my own vision."

    silver "You're acting kind of spacey today.  Is something bothering you?"

    alex "No, nothing at all."

    "I smile at him and I quickly tap back into Toffee's senses for another moment or two.  I wonder. . .should I tell him?  That would be the sensible thing to do, right?  Of course it is.  But then I also consider the possibilities of this newfound skill.  What if it works when I'm not actually here?  It would be a lot more fun to toy around with this when he doesn't know about it."

    "I decide I want to keep this new piece of information to myself, at least until I have a chance to play around with it.  If I thought there was a chance that he might be angry upon learning that I hid this from him, I probably wouldn't, but I can imagine that he would find it quite funny.  Besides, I can't help but hope that I might catch him in a vulnerable moment and see a side of him that is not normally reserved for my presence."

    "It is difficult to keep my plans hidden, however, as I find myself brimming with impatience to leave so I can test my theory.  He catches me grinning more than a few times as I consider the possibilities."

    "Still, I try to remain patient as Silver Phoenix continues to run a few more mild experiments on the creature, all of which it responds intelligently to.  I try not to interfere with these, reminding myself that I'll have my fun later.  All the while, he's shooting me amused looks that are laced with suspicion due to my own poorly disguised excitement.  He says nothing, but it's clear he knows something must be up.  He seems to have concluded, however, that it's harmless enough to leave alone.  When the time comes, I am quick to excuse myself, giving him a quick, affectionate kiss goodbye and leaving him with a puzzled expression."

    "I return to my room, hoping he doesn't decide to use this moment to take a break from Virtuality, or my fun will be ruined.  I immediately collapse into my desk chair and put in a request to [avatar_name] that she take a break until the next time I call for her, so I don't lose my concentration.  With that done, I try to make a connection with the creature again, and quickly come to the realization that I'm not entirely sure how I did it before.  Was it picturing the creature?  I try this first and find the task quite difficult despite the fact that I spent a large part of the day watching it.  It was such an unusual little thing. . ."

    "After several minutes of thinking about the little creature and its strange movements, I am met with no success.  I am starting to wonder if this ability just isn't as fantastic as I first thought.  Maybe I really do have to be right there in order for it to work. . ."

    "Close to giving up, I lean back in the chair and sigh.  I begin to lament how lucky that little creature is; it gets to spend all its time with him regardless.  It probably doesn't even know how good it has it!  He probably has it cuddled up in his lap right now!  Maybe I should go back-at least I could spend the time with him."

    "My vision goes funny-switched out for another's-but not long enough for me to read the situation.   But I know instantly:  this is what I was trying to achieve all along.  I think a little harder on how much I would like to be there with him, resting in his lap and being showered with his affections. I try to imagine the feeling with all of my senses, but quickly find that I don't need to-I'm already there, occupying the senses of the creature."

    "I feel so small.  This feeling should be frightening, but really it is a great comfort, as I can feel totally enveloped by his warmth.  He's sitting at his desk and staring intently at a long blocks of information which I cannot read from where I am sitting.  He strokes my head every few seconds and occasionally looks down; with these things, I'm happy to sit there for several minutes, but I soon find myself curious about what he's looking at.  Every now and then he removes his hand from my head to hold his own and emit a little sigh, as though whatever he's reading pains him somehow.  Only the friendly presence on his lap and the cup of tea sitting on his desk which he occasionally sips from seem to bring comfort."

    "My curiosity is growing.  Is this something small and harmless which is bothering him, or is this a chance to learn something about him that I don't know?  I didn't really intend to use my ability to see through Toffee's senses as a way to snoop into such personal things, but I'm finding that the temptation is too great to behave myself."

    "I take a moment to figure out how to \"pilot\" my host, and shakily climb onto my four feet.  He looks down on me, curious at my sudden movement."

    silver "What'cha doing?  You getting bored?"

    "I can feel myself-my real self-wanting to laugh at his cheerfully bemused expression.  But I know if I give into this urge, I'll end up breaking my connection with the creature.  Instead, I try to focus on what's before me."

    "I climb up onto the desk in order to get a closer look at what he's working on.  Of course, this also entails me stepping right into his line of sight and blocking his view.  Before I have a chance to even make sense of the long blocks of text in front of me, his hands take hold of my sides and I find myself being lifted into the air.  He holds me just inches from his face, my weird little legs dangling like a ragdoll's would."

    silver "Now you know I like having you around, but you have got to let me focus."

    "Of course, he's not really expecting an answer, so he soon sets me back down in his lap and resumes his work."

    "Naturally, I'm not content to just continue laying there; when an opportunity arises, I scramble my way back onto the desk.  He snatches me up once more before I have had a chance to read anything and tries to gently sweep me to the side.  In the process of doing this, however, he brushes the cup of tea on his desk and tips it over.  Some of it spills onto the surface of the desk and drip down on the floor, but a hearty amount also splashes onto his lap and fingers and in his hair.  He sets me down and looks at the mess in mild dismay."

    "This being Virtuality, however, the mess is easily done away with.  The spilled tea, and whatever stains it might have created are all easily willed away; though it breaks the illusion that Virtuality is a new reality, it certainly is a convenience.  Still, even with the mess cleaned up, Silver Phoenix is looking uncomfortable.  He's likely experiencing one of the strange side effects of Virtuality-even though messes can be cleaned up in Virtuality, if something gets on me, I find the only thing that gets rid of the feeling of being sticky or dirty is going through the motion of washing off.  Nothing ever actually happens to our real bodies, but our minds are convinced that it did and needs the normal remedy to be convinced that the problem is gone.  Aside from this, the shower can be quite relaxing too, even if it's not needed."

    "Silver Phoenix stands and clears away whatever he was looking at.  He looks down at me, not quite annoyed, but confused by the sudden outburst of odd behavior.  He lightly touches my nose and tells me to keep out of trouble for a moment until he returns."

    "A small private shower area appears in one of the corners of the room and he heads towards it.  I sit there on the chair for a moment, wondering what my next course of action is.  Of course, I quickly make up my mind on that matter the moment I see him tugging off his jacket and sliding down his pants. I make a clumsy leap down from the chair and start to toddle after him, all the while wondering whether this is an unfair invasion of his privacy.  But hearing the subtle plop his clothes beyond the half-wall that blocks off the shower reminds me that I abandoned the self-righteous route the moment I came here.  With this matter decided, I make my way on four wobbly legs to the wall he disappeared behind.  I hear the water start and peek my head around the corner."

    "I expect the sight to have only a middling effect on me, as it's nothing wholly new, but boy am I wrong!  The sight of him standing there, the water pouring down him and glistening off his every curve. . .He tips his head back, eyes shut and grins as the steaming water runs down his backside."

    "I become aware of my own body again-heat consumes my face as I can't help blushing at the sight that lays before me.  I'm struggling to keep control of the creature as I feel a few other. . .sensations taking hold.  In my efforts, I fall back on my behind, legs clumsily splayed out as I flail helplessly in the water that coats the floor."

    "His eyes open and his gaze snaps towards me.  I can't tell if the smile he wears is amused or merely exasperation.  He tilts his head and kneels down in front of me, letting the water cascade onto his back."

    silver "Well now, that's unusual."

    "I look around, my composure still slipping, wondering what he finds so unusual.  He does not keep me guessing."

    silver "I've never seen you turn that color before!"

    "I wonder what he is talking about, but then I look down at the my-or rather Toffee's- body.  The strange material that fills its glass insides, instead of being the usual blue, is a jarring magenta."

    silver "So many strange things going on with you today.  It's so odd, since it didn't start until. . ."

    "A contemplative look crosses his face.  He stands suddenly and resumes washing off, all the while affixing me with a focused look while I work to regain balance on my four gangly limbs.  I wonder if others have experienced such a thing before. . .trying to function in a body so inherently different from your own.  I almost forget about the splendid sight in front of my new eyes in my musings.  Thankfully, it's no longer such a shock.  He really does look beautiful."

    "He cuts the water off and then steps out.  There's almost something purposeful to his movement as he quickly redresses himself.  He's still watching me."

    "Once he's fully attired he comes back and plucks me up.  I wonder if he had somehow taken pity on my awkward fumbling and decided to just carry me back to whatever part of the room we were going next."

    "But then something quite strange happens-we leave his office.  We're going to some other part of Virtuality.  Our destination loads before I even have a chance to wonder where we were off to or why."

    "I immediately recognize this new place as extremely familiar, but for some reason my mind seems to be miles behind my eyes right now.  He holds me like a ragdoll against his hip.  Everything is starting to come together."

    "He swings us around to face a new direction, and I see myself slumped over in my desk chair, eyes looking distant.  He's reaching forward now.  Of course!   This is-"

    "My eyesight abruptly shifts back.  Everything seems all wrong for a moment, but then I realize I am seeing through my own eyes again.  There is a firm hand resting on my shoulder.

    silver ". . ."

    "Should I. . .say something?  I start to worry if maybe he really is mad."

    "A real-sized giraffe could have easily fit into the gigantic pause that takes place between us, until finally, his composed expression collapses into laughter.  He dumps Toffee into my lap as he leans over the desk, shoulders still shaking from the sudden outburst of laughter."

    "I sit there, mouth hanging open a little as I wonder if I should speak up. Thankfully, his hysteria quickly resolves itself."

    silver "So how did you do it?"

    alex "W-what do you mean?"

    "I'm stifling a guilty smile as my face turns red.  The farce soon ends as a wave of laughter escapes me.  He takes a seat the corner of my desk until the laughter subsides.  He still looks pretty amused by the whole situation, which is a good thing, for my sake."

    silver "So come on, tell me!"

    alex "First. . .tell me how you figured it out!"

    "Of course, he was under no obligation to answer the question, but he answers anyway."

    silver "Well, earlier you had me suspicious when you wanted to leave so early.  To be honest, I was a little concerned when you left so early this afternoon.  I  was worried I had offended you somehow, or that something was wrong.  But then right after you left, Toffee started acting very oddly.  Normally it's quite content to just lay there for hours without hardly moving-but this time it became quite restless, almost like it wanted to see what I was doing. . ."

    "He stops with eyebrows raised.  I blush again-my snooping has been exposed.  Thankfully, that smile is still there on his face, so he can't be too bothered."

    silver "Not to mention the sudden clumsiness and poor motor functions.  And following me into the shower."

    "He laughs and begins playing with my hair a little.  If I were a cartoon character, steam would be pouring out of my ears as my face continues to grow hotter."

    silver "Your turn."

    alex "Well. . .at first it was sort of an accident.  I was just thinking about the Toffee, wishing I could be in its shoes a little because of all the attention it was getting from you, and it just sort of . . .happened.  Suddenly I was seeing and feeling things from that Toffee's perspective!  I could even stay that way as long as I could keep my focus."

    silver "And so you decided to have a little fun with this newfound ability."

    alex "Well, yeah. . .But I was gonna tell you eventually!"

    silver "Well, I can't say that I wouldn't have done the same thing.  In fact, I may have found even more creative ways to toy with you."

    "He chuckles a little and plucks Toffee from my lap."

    alex "So. . .you're not mad then, right?"

    silver "No, I'm not mad.  I actually find it quite funny. . .and also pretty intriguing that such a thing was possible in the first place.  But I will be on guard for such snooping in the future.  And I will be expecting a detailed report of your experiences from you sometime in the near future."

    alex "O-of course."

    silver "And, I expect that you will be taking custody Toffee yourself more often so that I might have an opportunity to orchestrate payback."

    "He says this all with a teasing smile, of course, followed by a quick peck on the cheek."

    silver "Now, then-I'm here now, so what shall we do?"

    alex "Oh. . .you seemed like you were pretty busy before.  Are you sure you have time to stay?"

    silver "For you, Alex, there are many things I am willing to put aside."

    "It doesn't take us long to settle into our usual routine of cuddling up to watch a movie accompanied with snacks.  Occasionally our attention drifts away from the movie for several minutes as we become more and more cozy with each other."

    "Our focus gets even further sidetracked with Silver Phoenix makes a few attempts at jumping into the Toffee's consciousness himself.  He's unsuccessful at first, seeming unable to form a connection at all-but after a few tries he's able to achieve success for several seconds."

    silver "Why's it so easy for you?"

    "He's pouting a little.  It's kind of cute in the \"sad puppy-dog\" way."

    alex "Is it so hard to accept that I'm better than you at something?"

    "I playfully nudge him and he cheers up a little."

    alex "If it's any consolation, both of the times I've done it, I really kind of wanted to be in Toffee's place at the time.  Maybe that's why it was so easy."

    silver "Hmm, yes, that must be it."

    alex "Of course, it could be that I'm just better at it."

    "He nudges me back with a grin.  A sudden, familiar sound rings throughout the room:  I have an incoming call.  The caller ID reads \"Mom\".  Oh, boy."

    "Silver Phoenix looks at me questioningly."

    silver "Should I leave?"

    alex "No, stay-I don't think this will take very long.  She's probably just calling to check in on a few things-it won't be anything too personal."

    "I pick up the call feeling relaxed, but the moment I see her face lit up in front of us, I remember that I'm not the only one she can see. Somehow, I didn't consider this.   She smiles at me, but her eyes quickly light in the direction of Silver Phoenix.  A questioning look crosses her face. Her eyes turn back to me."

    mom "Hi, Alex!  I was just calling to give you a quick hello from both of us back home since I know it's been awhile.  . . .I'm not interrupting anything am I?"

    "She's trying not to let her gaze linger on Silver Phoenix, but I can tell that the curiosity is overwhelming.  I wish I could gauge whether it was a good kind of curiosity."

    "Everybody's waiting-it's my move.  I've got to think quick."

    alex "No, it's all right, Mom-what did you need?"

    "I ignore her questioning gazes and try to forge onward in the conversation, despite the fact that the awkwardness has taken up a crushing presence in the room.  Silver Phoenix tries to turn his own gaze away from the image of my mother, not wanting to intrude, though I can tell he's not happy to be excluded.  Is it me, or does he move slightly away from me on the couch?"

    "Mom, not wanting to probe or cause embarrassment, keeps her questions to herself for now, but I imagine that before too long I'll get another call from her, brimming with all the questions left unasked right now.  She asks me how my new job is going, to which I tell her everything is going great, my voice cracking ever so slightly."

    "We talk a little about Dad, dipping only briefly into the financial details of his treatment.   Just a few routine things, as I had expected.   Would the conversation have drifted into more pleasant things if I had introduced them?  It seems like it's too late to go back now."

    "The conversation does not last very long, as the air becomes  a bit terse.  Mom maintains her smile, but seems to sense that a longer conversation would be suited for another time.  Mercifully, she puts things to an end for now."

    "She wishes me goodnight, promising to call again soon, and ends the call.  For a moment, there's only silence between Silver Phoenix and I.  Is he upset that I didn't introduce him?  Maybe I should have gone for it after all."

    alex "Look, I'm sorry, I-"

    silver "No need to explain yourself, you were caught off-guard, it's fine."

    "But I can tell from his curt tone that things are decidedly not fine.  I reach out and place a hand on his shoulder, hoping to bring his defenses back down so we can at least discuss it honestly, but his body only becomes more tense."

    alex "Hey, listen, I really want to introduce you two for real sometime, I just-"

    silver "I already said that the situation was settled, didn't I?"

    "His mouth is forcing a smile, but all the while his eyes are locked in an expression that seems as though he's daring me to try and continue this conversation."

    "With a heavy sigh, I throw up my hands and decide to give up on it for now. He's never been the type to hold a grudge, and I'm hoping that applies here, too, because I'm not sure how to fix it short of giving him the proper introduction he probably deserved.  I'm just not ready for that."

    "He dutifully keeps up the façade of being \"fine\" for a little while longer before excusing himself to complete some unfinished task that \"simply can't wait\".  I can only hope that by tomorrow he'll be back to his usual sweet and smiling self."

    "After he leaves, I find myself wandering around the room, thoughts just as aimless as my actions."

    "I'm feeling lost-up until now, things had been going so well between us.  I know that tonight was just a small stumble, but it's got me thinking about so many other things."

    "Are things really going well?  I mean, we're basically still in the same place we were a few weeks ago.  Our relationship still only begins and ends in Virtuality.  Maybe that's satisfying to him, but to me, the possibility of having something more still looms above my head.  I want it, but am afraid of jeopardizing what I already have by going for something out of my reach."

    "But on the other hand. . .I know that I deserve to get what I want too. . .right?  I'm know I won't really feel happy or satisfied if everything stays as it is.  But. . .is it really worth the risk?"

    ". . .Ugh."

    "I know that I'm just going around in circles, but what can I do?"
    "What I need is an outside opinion, the thoughts of someone with nothing at stake-What I need is another appointment with Doctor Giamo-that'll help set my head straight, or at least give me some guidance.  Well, hopefully, anyway."
    "I thought ahead after my last appointment and booked another a few weeks into the future.  It's just a couple days away now. . .this is perfect.  I know that I could also rely on my parents for a good pep talk, but as for actual objective advice, Doctor Giamo is probably the best choice."

    "I just have to keep this dilemma from consuming my thoughts until then.  Just got to keep moving forward."

    #TODO [end of scene, next scene-Dr. Giamo's office]"

    giamo "So, how has everything been since we've last me, Alex?  Give me an update on your life.  As I recall, last time you were still struggling to try and arrange a meeting between yourself and your partner outside of Virtuality, correct?"

    alex "Well . . .yeah."

    giamo "Any progress on that, Alex?"

    alex "I don't think so.  We haven't really talked about it again, and I get the feeling he really doesn't want to broach the subject anymore."

    giamo "Do you feel as though he might have resolvable concerns on the matter? –Some fear that could possibly be conquered so that this meeting could take place?"

    alex "I'm not sure, but I don't even think it matters anymore."

    giamo "Why's that?"

    alex "I just feel like I'm pushing him into something he doesn't want. And even if some part of him does want it, I feel like it will be a really long before I can convince him to take a chance on me and just do it."

    giamo "So, what does that mean for you, Alex?  Will you be unhappy if things continue exactly as they already are?"

    alex "I think so. . .I wish I could be satisfied with just knowing him as I do now, but I'm sick of trying to balance my real life with my life in Virtuality.  I want to be able to enjoy things like holidays with my family and him, or things like dinners, or just to be able to see his real face, even just once."

    "Doctor Giamo sighs and sits forward with his fingers folded across his knee."

    giamo "Alex, this is always a difficult thing to say to a patient, but it sounds like you may need to reevaluate your relationship.  I don't want you to feel as though I'm trying to influence you to make one decision or another, but what you're saying concerns me.  You have an idea of what is important to you, and you aren't getting that out of this relationship currently; you also feel that there is a legitimate chance that you will never have these things, either."

    alex "What do you think I should do?"

    giamo "As I said, Alex, it wouldn't be right for me to tell you what you should or should not do; ultimately, it is your life, and while I don't think that the information you've given me is in any way inaccurate, I only have a fraction of your experiences to form an opinion on."

    "I think it would be best for you to go home and think hard about what it is that's most important for you.  Assuming that meeting in person is forever off the table, would that be okay with you?  Or would you come to resent him for not giving you something that clearly matters to you.  Would you be able to feel satisfied if you always had to manage your Virtuality relationship and your real life relationships separately?"

    alex "I. . .I don't know."

    giamo "I think it's important that you come up with an answer soon, otherwise, the uncertainty may start to create other problems.  But I would advise you to do this on your own time, without another person here to influence your thoughts and decisions.  Go home, do something to clear your head, and then start challenging yourself with these questions and see what you come up with.  Once you feel that you've thought about it thoroughly, and weighed every possible consequence, you may find that your next course of action is clear."

    alex "Okay. . .I'll try."

    giamo "I know, it probably still sounds quite overwhelming.  I wish I could give you some better guidance, but such an important decision can only be made by you.  Just think about what's important to you and you'll do fine."

    "I see myself out, thanking him for his help.  I know that he's right when he says I should be making this decision without someone else's influence, but right now I just wish I had someone whispering all the right answers in my ear.  Do I really know what's best for me?  Do I even know what I want?"

    "Ugh, he's right-I need to clear my head of this for a while.  But how?  If I go back to my place, I'll just sit around and get lost in my own thoughts; if I go to his place, well, I definitely won't be able to get my current situation out of my head.  So, what's left?  It's not like I have any close friends I can just drop in on anymore.  Aside from my mother, I don't really talk to anyone other than Silver Phoenix anymore."

    "Wait, that's it. . .All these months of exchanging phone calls, and I haven't dropped in to see her once.  I've been so wrapped up in everything.  Suddenly, the thought of spending some quality time with someone, anyone, in the real world sounds like just the right thing to do, even more so  knowing how much the visit will be appreciated."

    "Yes. . .this sounds like just the way to spend the afternoon."

    #TODO [end of scene, change to Alex's mother's living room]"

    mom "Can I get you anything else, dear?  Some marshmallows for that hot cocoa, or some cookies, maybe?"

    alex "No thanks, Mom, I think the cocoa, the brownies, and the muffins will do for now."

    mom "Oh, you know I can't help it-I haven't had you around to spoil in such a long time!  Now that your father has to watch his diet, half the things I bake just go to waste.  But wouldn't you know it, I'd rather that happen than stop baking!"

    alex "Well, I wouldn't complain if you decided to send some home with me!"

    "I've been eating Virtuality sweets for so long, I'd almost forgotten that there's a small, almost implacable yet crucial difference between them and the real thing. Is it the feel of it my hands?  The sensory anticipation I feel as I look down at the treat I'm holding?  Or is it in the taste-something that's just slightly more vibrant?"

    "On its own, Virtuality easily succeeds in its imitation; put side-by-side, however, I have a feeling that few would be able to get the two mixed up."

    "My mother gleefully settles beside me, her own cup of coffee in hand."

    mom "So what's going on, Alex?   I'm surprised that you came to visit.  Oh, not that I'm anything less than ecstatic to have you here, though!"

    alex "I just. . .needed to get out of Virtuality for a while, think about a few things."

    mom "Oh?  Is everything all right?  I hope my meddling hasn't caused you any trouble."

    alex "Oh, no,  Mom-definitely not!  I've actually been meaning to thank you; my visits with Doctor Giamo have actually helped out a lot.  I go to see him from time to time and he helps me figure out what matters to me.  I know it's not what you originally had in mind, but I really do want to thank you for suggesting I go to him."

    mom "As long as you're happy, Alex.  I hope I wasn't being too pushy before, but I really was worried.  It seemed like you had lost your direction in life the past few years.  You didn't seem happy to me anymore."

    alex "Yeah. . .I guess I got a bit wrapped up in certain things."

    "Things that I couldn't care less about anymore. . .after all that time."

    mom "Oh, but there's no reason to dwell on such things."

    alex "You know. . .I think I'm going to start making time for more things outside of Virtuality, soon.  I feel like I've been missing out on a lot lately."

    mom "I'll be sure to tell your father.  I can't keep you all to myself, you know, as much as I'd like to!  It's a shame he isn't home right now, but now that he's feeling better he doesn't really listen when I tell him to take it easy.  He's out fishing with some friends right now, but I'll make sure you two get some quality time together soon."

    alex "You're always looking out for the both of us, Mom, do you ever take time for yourself?"

    mom "In fact, I do! . . .Actually, speaking of, Alex, I'm afraid I'll have to cut your visit a bit short since I'm going out to lunch with a couple of the girls from my book club.  Oh. . .but you're welcome to come  along if you like!"

    alex "That's all right. . .you go have fun. "

    mom "We're always happy to see you."

    "We both stand and she immediately wraps me into the sort of hug only a mother can give.  A few years ago, I might have quickly wriggled my way out of it with some playful complaint.  But having already been made to face the reality that my parents aren't going to be around forever, I find myself trying to soak in every detail. . ."

    "This. . .these are the things that matter: the tiny little coincidences and accidents that color our memories."

    "A storm of questions is raging in my mind  as I tell my mother goodbye and begin to leave.  My body is on autopilot."

    "Am I really okay knowing that I might never get to embrace him for real-knowing that every little detail around us is part of a perfectly planned reality, without room for happenstance?"

    "At a glance, it might seem like a small thing, but I know that it's something I would miss terribly, I'm certain of it.  But. . .it's more than that.  I want him included in my reality.  I want him to someday sit in this room-me, my mother, my father. . .and him.  All the most important people in my life, all a part of the same reality."

    "If I sit on this, let myself calm down and think it over, I'll just fall into inaction.  I'll convince myself that I'm okay with how things are, how things will continue to be; I'll pretend that I'm content until the next thing comes along that reminds me of what I'm missing."

    "Enough.  I can't keep torturing myself like this.  I just need to go and look him the eye and speak my peace.  And it has to happen right now."

    silver "Alex!  I'd go on about how nice it is to have you drop in like this, but the rather grim look on your face suggests that something may be amiss.  Is everything all right?"

    "To have him looking at me with such concern. . .it almost makes me lose courage.  I wish desperately that the doubt and dissent  I'm feeling will just melt away any instant now, leaving only good feelings. "

    silver "Alex. . .?"

    "I swiftly take a seat across from him.  My courage still hasn't fled me, but my words have.  For the moment, I can only just sit there, hands folded, jaw working to find the missing words."

    "Several seconds pass, and I hear a little sigh from across from me.  Silver Phoenix gets up from his chair and comes to kneel beside me, placing a hand on my leg."

    silver "Come on, Alex-did something happen?"

    alex "I just. . .I've been doing some thinking.  A lot of thinking."

    silver "What about?"

    alex "Do you think. . ."

    "He's right. . .Better to just get it out and over with."

    silver "Alex, we've already spoken about this.  I. . .I just don't know if it's a good idea.  I mean, it's certainly a possibility that someday-"

    alex "No, you don't understand!  I can't keep waiting on a \"maybe someday\".  This is important to me, why can't you just say yes?"
    "He stands and moves away.  He turns his face away, too, almost facing his back to me."

    silver "For the same reason you just can't let it go-it's just how I feel."

    alex "Can't you at least try. . .?"

    silver "No."

    "For a moment, there is stunned silence between us.  Before now, a part of me still held out hope that this would have gone better; that he would have seen how much this mattered to me and agreed to it at once.  I guess I was hoping for that outcome so much that I'd stopped considering the more likely alternative."

    "And. . ."

    "Here we are.  But. . .what now?"

    alex "I'm sorry."

    "The two words come out of my mouth before I even understand why."

    silver "Alex, you don't have to apologize for asking.  I understand why."

    alex "No, I'm sorry because. . ."

    "I stand up with a heavy sigh."

    alex "I'm sorry because I don't think I can do this anymore."

    silver "I'm afraid I don't understand."

    alex "I appreciate what we have in Virtuality, I really do.  But. . .what happens in the real world is always going to be more important to me.  I can't really explain why.  I wish I could, but, I'm not going to be happy if we can't meet in person."

    silver "Alex-"

    alex "I could pretend like I'm happy for your sake, but that would be doing us both a disservice.  Besides, I don't think I could keep up a farce like that."

    silver "What are you saying?  That you want to. . ."

    alex "I think it would be best for both of us if we considered this goodbye."

    silver "I don't understand-where is this coming from?  Did I do something to upset you?  Can't we sit down and talk about it?"
    alex "No, it's not your fault.  I didn't wake up today planning to do this.  I just know that it has to be done now.  If we talk about it, you'll almost certainly convince me that I'm making the wrong decision and things might go back to normal for a while, but I know I won't be happy.  And I think you'll know it too, even if you won't say anything about it."

    "I don't want this to end, but this just isn't going to work."

    silver "And even knowing that someday I might be ready to meet in person. . .that's not enough for you?"

    alex "No, because I know that there's an equal, if not greater chance, that that \"someday\" will never come."

    silver "And by \"goodbye\" you mean. . ."

    alex "I won't be coming here anymore, not for any reason."

    silver ". . .I see."

    "He's turning further away from me; not in anger, though.  His face is contorted as though in pain.  I hate hurting him like this, but if things go on, I'll just end up hurting him more.  We'll be hurting each other."

    "I wish I knew what he was thinking."

    alex "I don't want to let this spoil what we had, though."

    "I reach out to touch his cheek.  His attention was so focused elsewhere that he did not see me approach, so he gave a little start as my skin touched his.  He turns around and places a hand over mine.  I can tell he's holding back something.  Is it tears?  Or is he fighting the urge to tell me how awful I'm being."

    silver "If you're going to go, then please go.  What are you waiting for?"

    alex "This is selfish, but. . .I want to end this the way we started it."

    silver "What do you-"

    "Before he can finish his question, I grab him gently and pull him to me.  He is too surprised to pull away or put up a resistance.  Our lips meet and I embrace him tightly."

    "These gestures have become so familiar to me, so quickly."

    "To know that this is the last time. . .Should I try to remember every detail, or. . .should I let myself forget and enjoy the moment as it is: something fleeting, something finite?"

    "The warmth of his lips seems to surge throughout my entire body."

    "Maybe this isn't like how it began.  Maybe if I had known where it was all going, I wouldn't have pulled away from his kiss in disgust and anger."
    "Our lips finally part, leaving a sweet taste on my lips, but he does not let go.  Not a word is exchanged between us.  He nuzzles against my neck, and I can feel that there might be tears forming in his eyes."

    "I take a deep breath, deciding that I do want to remember this moment. . .but not as sad, or even bittersweet.  I want to remember it, and everything that has come before it, as happy."

    "It's time."

    "But before I can say another word, Silver Phoenix stands up and makes a sort of stiff, half-bowing motion."

    silver "You can call me Silver Phoenix, ma'am.  It's very nice to meet you."

    mom "Oh but you don't have to be so formal!  It's very nice to meet you too, dear.  May I call you Silver?  That name of yours is quite the mouthful."

    silver "Of course!  That's perfectly fine."

    "His posture is relaxing a little, and his smile is becoming even more genuine.  He takes a seat once more beside me."

    mom "I have a thousand questions for you already, dear, but I won't subject you to that, now.  You seem like a nice young man, though, and I can only assume that you're the reason my Alex has been so preoccupied as of late."

    "Now it's my turn to look bashful."

    silver "Yes, I'm afraid you can pin that one on me, ma'am."

    mom "Oh, please, call me Sandra."

    "They're both grinning and looking so at ease.  Suddenly I'm wondering why I was ever worried."

    mom "Now, Silver, I have a bit of a favor to ask of you, in exchange for spiriting away my son."

    silver "Oh?  What can I do for you?"

    mom "You can continue keeping Alex as preoccupied as you have been, just as long as you promise to make sure he remembers to call his parents once in a while."

    alex "Mom!"

    silver "I don't know, Alex, I think that's a pretty fair deal to me."

    "He gives me a sly smile and squeezes my hand."

    silver "I will ensure sure he makes the effort to visit you on occasion."

    mom "Oh, that would be wonderful!  His father and I would like that very much.  And I'm sure we would like it even more if you came along sometime."

    silver "Perhaps. . ."

    "He's still smiling, but it's more polite than genuine."

    mom "But of course, I won't push it.  After all, maybe I'll try out this Virtuality thing myself someday and we can have our get-together on more comfortable terms?"

    "She's perceptive as always-an expert at reading a situation.  Silver Phoenix instantly relaxes."

    silver "That sounds like it would be nice, don't you think, Alex?"
    alex "Yeah, although are you sure you can figure out Virtuality, Mom?  It doesn't seem like it'd be your thing."

    mom "You watch yourself there, young man-just because Virtuality wasn't around when I was young, doesn't mean I can't get the hang of it!"

    silver "Yes, Alex, respect your mother.  She seems like a very intelligent person."

    "He gives me a playful shove.  I'm glad that they're getting along so well, but I'm starting to feel like it's coming at my expense!"

    mom "You seem like a brilliant young man, yourself-although the flattery probably helps! . . . In any case, I can tell Alex has been in good hands-and to think I was so worried about all the time he was spending in Virtuality.  I wish you would have just told me sooner, dear, and eased your poor mother's mind."

    alex "Sorry, Mom, it but wasn't exactly the easiest thing to talk about."

    "I'm blushing harder than ever.  Hopefully next time, picking on me won't be the only conversation topic of choice."

    mom "All right, Alex-I'm done teasing you tonight.  I'll let the two of you get back to your evening together.  Do you mind if I share the good news with your father, or would you rather tell him yourself?"

    alex "I'll let you do the honors, Mom."

    mom "If that's what you'd like.  But I wouldn't be surprised if he calls you up sometime to get the full story.  You know what he's like when he hears something interesting."

    alex "Well, it'll be nice to hear from him, too, I suppose."

    mom "All right, then.  You two have a good night!"

    "We both wish her a good night and her image disappears.  There's silence for a moment, but not the uncomfortable type; it's the type in which we can both digest what just happened and where things were going.  He's still holding onto my hand, but his grip is light and relaxed now.  Every so often, his hand flexes as though to check if I'm still there."

    alex "Hey. . .I'm sorry if that was a little weird."

    silver "Weird, Alex?  No, it wasn't weird at all.  I actually enjoyed it.  Your mother is a very kind person-very warm, and friendly.  She makes me feel as though I'm already a member of the family, as though we'd actually known each other for some time."

    alex "Yeah, she's really good at getting to know people.  But. . . mean, that must have been jarring, right?  I mean, I know I wasn't expecting to have that conversation tonight!"

    silver "Surprising as it was, I'm glad it was had, and I appreciate you making it happen.  I could tell it wasn't easy for you at first."

    "He brushes back some of my hair and leans against me, pushing us both back into a reclining position, with him laying on my chest."

    silver "It really does mean a lot to me."

    alex "It means a lot to me, too.  I want you to be a part of all aspects of my life."

    silver "I want that, too."

    alex "Did you really mean that about meeting up with my mom in Virtuality?"

    silver "Yes, of course!  I wouldn't lie about such a thing.  I know it would probably mean a lot to both of you."

    alex "She loves sweets just as much as you do, so I'm sure you'll get along even better in person."

    silver "You don't have to win me over, Alex-I'm already sold on the idea!"

    "He reassuringly wraps his arms around me and squeezes me tight."

    silver "I'm sorry. . .I'm sorry I cannot do more than that for you."

    alex "You mean meeting for real?"

    silver "Yes."

    alex "Well . . .maybe someday, right?"

    silver "Maybe."

    "The way he says this does not instill me with confidence.  Still, I won't let it get me down."

    "I mean. . .is it really such a big deal anymore, anyway?  Things seem like they're coming together for the two of us.  Maybe this is something I can be happy with after all. . .would it be wrong if I settled for this?"

    "And would it really be settling if I'm actually happy?"

    silver "Alex?  Is everything okay?  You have this faraway look in your eye-I hope I didn't upset you just now.  I just-"

    alex "No, it's okay, you don't have to explain.  I'm. . .okay."

    "I flash a genuine smile and pull him and pull his arms tight around me."

    "We stay like this for a while before he suddenly breaks his grip on me and sits forward."

    silver "I'm sorry, Alex, I just remembered that I have a few calls to make before it gets too late.  I hope you don't mind if I excuse myself a little early today."

    alex "I wish you could stay, but I understand.  I don't suppose you can tell me what it's for, though?"

    silver "I'm afraid not."

    "As he finishes saying this, he stands and leans over me to plant a kiss on my forehead.  Then, he's gone."

    "I don't like not knowing all that there is to know about him and what's going on in his life, or knowing that I may never know these things, but as I sit in silence I find myself wondering if it has to matter.  Can't we be happy just as we are?"

    "I feel like it shouldn't be possible, but I so desperately want it to be. . ."

    "I know that if I keep thinking about this by myself, I'll just go around in circles."

    "What if. . .what if I talk it over with someone else?  Someone who has to be impartial. . . Of course, a certain person is coming to mind-Dr. Giamo.  I don't expect him to tell me what to do with my life or our relationship, but. . .saying all these thoughts out loud to another person. . .I think it will help."

    "Yes, it's decided.  It's time to make one last appointment."

    #"End of scene-move to Dr. Giamo's office"
    giamo "It's good to see you again, Alex.  I'm glad we were able to make an appointment for you the day after you called. . .although I hope it's nothing too upsetting that's brought you here."

    alex "Everything's okay for the most part.  I think I just need to clear my head a little.  I've been having some conflicting thoughts lately."

    giamo "Oh?  Does this relate to what we discussed last time-about meeting your significant other in person?"

    alex "Well. . .in a way.  We still haven't met yet, in case you're wondering."
    giamo "And how is that affecting you?"
    alex "That's just it. . .I feel like I should be more upset about it-like I should still be more bothered about it than I am right now."
    giamo "If that's how you think you should feel, then how do you feel?"
    alex "I feel. . .well, still somewhat upset about it.  I really do wish it would happen, but. . .I feel like I'm coming to terms with the idea that it might now.  Like. . .it might not be the end of things.  Almost like I could be happy if we kept things as they are-only in Virtuality."
    giamo "Are these feelings concerning to you somehow?"
    alex "Yes, but I don't understand why."
    giamo "Well it seems to me, Alex, that you're worried about whether or not you're being truthful to yourself about being satisfied with your relationship as it is."
    alex "Well. . .yeah.  Is it even possible for me to just stop caring about something that meant so much to me just a little while ago?"
    giamo "People change what they want all the time, just as easily as the wind changes direction."
    alex "Yeah, but for something so important?"
    giamo "I think that you'll find that it's not all that uncommon; especially when one finds something that matters even more important-such as preserving your relationship.  It seems to me, Alex, that maintaining what you have right now is more important to you than what you could potentially have."
    alex "Isn't it bad to just settle for something less than you want, though?"
    giamo "Sometimes.  But only if doing so will lead to you being unhappy."
    alex "I guess that just brings us right back to the beginning."
    giamo "You know, Alex, no matter what you choose here, there will always be some risk involved.  What you want might change again-you can't possibly predict something like that.  All you can do is make the best possible decision for yourself right now.  Do you think, judging by your current situation, that you can be happy if you stop pursuing an in-reality meeting?"
    alex "I. . ."
    giamo "Perhaps this isn't the best setting to answer such an important question.  You don't have to reach a decision right now, or even today.  You might want to think about something else, even.  I have a feeling that you will discover the answer when you aren't even trying."
    "Suddenly I feel so dazed.  Is he saying I'll just \"know\" what's right for me when I see it?"
    "We talk for a few more minutes about other things, but my mind is already elsewhere.  When I finally rise to leave, Giamo gives me a reassuring pat on the shoulder."
    giamo "You have a lot of people in your life that care about you, Alex, no matter what you choose to pursue."
    "I know he means well, and I know that everything he says so far has helped, but I wish that I could replace his supportive words with a gleaming beacon to point me toward exactly the right answer."
    "He told me to try and relax without searching too hard for the answer.  The best possible way to do that would be for me to take some time by myself, maybe read a book or something.  But. . .without even thinking about it, I'm disobeying that suggestion."
    "Out of sheer habit, I travel to Silver Phoenix's office.  He's there, of course, his figure bent over a display of some sort of data, looking weary."
    "He gives a little start as I reach out and touch his shoulder, not having seen or heard me approach.  When his eyes light upon my face, he perks up by an immense degree.  Before I can say a word, I find myself locked into a snug embrace.  He doesn't say anything, only breathes deeply."
    "Is something wrong, or is he just glad to see me?  I sense that now is not the moment for talking."
    "My arms wind their way around him as well, my chin tucked over his shoulder just as his is on mine."
    "I close my eyes and breathe in. . ."
    "It's such a comforting feeling to be held like you are needed.  He pulls me even tighter, nearly squeezing the air out of me."
    "I breathe out. . ."
    "It seems like so much has happened in such a short time.  Not that long ago I was trying to carry out some strange vendetta against him, trying to prove that I was better than him.  But now. . .all I want is to have him next to me."
    "What would have happened if he hadn't made that first move, the kiss that angered me so much?  What would I even be doing right now?"
    "I feel his grip on me gradually loosen until he pulls away to look directly at me."
    alex "You know, I'm glad to get such an enthusiastic greeting, but what's the occasion?"
    silver "There isn't one.  Sometimes just seeing you is exactly what I need, you know?"
    alex "Yeah. . .I know what you mean."
    silver "You remind me that there's a lot of things to be happy about."
    "Right now, he's blushing and looking content, but underneath all that I see a great deal of tiredness and stress.  I wish I knew what caused him to feel that way. . .but I'm glad that I can help relieve those feelings at least."
    "He grabs onto my hand and leads me away from whatever he was working on, over to our usual cozy spot.  Our little experiment is there waiting, just as exuberant as ever.  It's bounding across the chairs as though playing some game by its own made-up rules.  When we sit, it immediately comes over to lap up the attention.  Such a curious little thing couldn't exist outside of Virtuality."
    "Sweets and hot tea are set out, and everything is just. . .wonderful. "
    silver "You should really invite your mother over for an afternoon sometime. . .if she ever gets the hang of Virtuality, that is.   It would be nice, don't you think?"
    "He looks at me at takes a long sip of his tea.  I hear the words, but I'm hardly listening.  A warm feeling is overtaking me-the feeling of total comfort and ease.  Maybe this is my moment of realization. . .or maybe it's just me reaching for one.  Either way I know that right now, in this particular moment, it  feels as though everything is falling into place.  This is how it's all supposed to be."
    silver "Alex, is everything okay?  You're spacing out a little."
    "I grin and settle into my chair and pat the odd, amorphous creature lying contentedly on my lap while letting my free hand wrap around his."
    alex "Yes.  Everything's. . . more than okay."
    "End."

    #TODO [GIR2] – ALEX TELLS ABOUT GIRAFFE"
    alex "Actually . . . "
    "He immediately sits up, nearly dumping Toffee out of his lap.  Toffee lazily readjusts and flicks its ears as though in annoyance."
    "Now how the heck to I tell him about this?"
    alex "I think I've just. . .experienced something you might find intriguing."
    "He gives me a sideways glance and a smirk."
    silver "Just right now, you mean?"
    alex "I know this is going to sound weird, but when I had my eyes shut, after a second my mind started drifting and. . .well, all of a sudden I was seeing and feeling through Toffee."
    "What I expected was a look of intrigue-that insatiable \"I must know more\" look he gets when stumbling across an interesting tidbit, but. . .what I get is a face frozen in a look of smirking skepticism."
    alex "Well say something!"
    "He chuckles a little.  I'm starting to get annoyed."
    silver "My dear Alex, I think you really may have been having a little dream over there.  Are you sure about all that?  It's been a long day, I'm sure I could fall asleep right now, too!"
    alex "I wasn't dreaming!  It really happened.  Why don't you believe me?"
    "Okay, now I am annoyed!"
    silver "I didn't say that I don't believe you Alex, I was just trying to suggest a more likely alternative."
    alex "Is it because you think I don't understand this stuff as much as you?  That I couldn't possibly have made a discovery on my own?"
    silver "Now that's not true, Alex.  Just try and calm down and listen to me for a second. "
    alex "I try to tell you about something I discovered, and the first thing you do is tell me I just dreamed it?  Why did you even invite me to help you on this stupid project in the first place if you don't think I can contribute on my own?"
    silver "I would do the same if it were my own discovery-It's just in my nature to-"
    alex "Would you stop just trying to explain everything away?  I'm so sick of all your calm and rational explanations for things.  Can't you tell how hurtful you're being?"
    silver "Perhaps I was out of line with what I said, but I think this is a bit too much for a little misunderstanding, Alex. . ."
    alex "How could I even be tired when all we do is lounge around drinking tea all day?"
    silver "Are you saying there's something wrong with that?"
    alex "Yes!  You're paying me to work for you, remember?  Or did you forget because it's been so long since we've actually done something?"
    silver "What about Toffee?  We were working with him today."
    alex "You mean playing with him and pretending its work.  And even when I learned something anyway, you just brush it off."
    silver "I already admitted I was wrong for that, Alex, I don't know what more to say.  I really do believe what you were telling me."
    "Alex, Alex, Alex-I'm sick of hearing my name coupled with his excuses."
    alex "You don't even get it!  It's not just about that.  I'm sick of being paid just to keep you company.  I don't deserve you throwing money at me to just sit here and accomplish nothing.  I don't care what the reason is, I'm tired of it!  Do you even understand how inadequate it makes me feel?"
    silver "Alex, I-"
    alex "I don't want to hear whatever dumb explanation you have right now."
    "With one last look at his stunned face, I abscond from his office back to the solitude of my own workspace."
    "I slam a hand against my desk in an attempt to relieve some frustration and heave a heavy sigh.  Unsurprisingly, [avatar_name] materializes in front of me.  The look of concern on her face could potentially beat out one of my mother's in terms of intensity."
    avatar "Sir, I'm detecting-"
    alex "Yeah, yeah, high blood-pressure or something like that, right?"
    avatar "Well, yes.  I would suggest-"
    alex "Look, I'm glad you're concerned, and I promise I'll lay down and try the relaxation techniques you've been pounding into my head, but I don't think any of them will work while you're lecturing me about my medical stats."
    avatar "Correct, a comfortable setting of solitude will best aide these methods.  I will leave you be and come to check on you later."
    "She's gone just as quickly as she appeared.  I immediately collapse onto the couch and throw up a hand over my eyes."
    "Maybe that was a little much. . ."
    "Maybe I shouldn't have stormed out like that, but. . .no, I'm sick of being paid for doing nothing!  Maybe he doesn't see a problem with it, but it's destroying my sense of dignity!"
    "I continue to wrestle with my thoughts until they exhaust my mind and I start to drift off to sleep. I find that my dreams are a lot more vivid in Virtuality, for whatever reason; I start dreaming about a 20-ft tall Toffee stomping its way through my hometown.  I jerk myself awake before he has a chance to stomp on me, only to find the real #(at least as I know him) Toffee toddling around on my outstretched legs as though they were bridges."
    alex "Wait, what the heck are you doing here?"
    "I prop myself up and Toffee continues on with whatever its doing without a care.  My gaze drifts around the room and I see another figure peering down at me from the other side of the couch.  Of course, it's him."
    "I let myself fall back against the couch."
    silver "I know you're not happy with me, but I didn't get a chance to properly apologize before you left."
    "I give him a silent stare, eyebrows raised as if to say \"go on. . .\""
    silver "May I sit down?"
    "Despite asking this, he's already moved my legs, found a comfortable spot, and placed Toffee in his lap."
    silver "I won't say I understand, because I really don't.  I know I invited you to come work with me initially, but I've found that over the time we've gotten to know each other, the time we spend just relaxing together is far more valuable to me."
    "I scrunch up my face at that last statement and begin to retort, but he cuts me off."
    silver "Er, that's not because I think your contributions to the research aren't valuable, I just. . .haven't had someone to connect with in a very long time.  I guess I have been going a little overboard with all the \"breaks\" we've been taking.  And I know that I've been stalling getting to the work in the first place. . .I just. . .what I mean to say is that it has nothing to do with you and your own abilities, and I'm sorry if my statements earlier gave you that impression."
    "He reaches out and takes my hand, still cradling Toffee with his other arm.  He gives my hand a gentle squeeze."
    silver "I'm sorry.  I, um, brought over Toffee so you could show me what you were talking about earlier."
    alex "I appreciate the gesture, but I don't think I could right now."
    silver "Right, um, well how about when we work next?  We can spend the afternoon running all sorts of tests and collecting all sorts of data.  We can even work through lunch if you want!"
    alex "Woah, you don't have to go overboard!  We can still relax some, I just don't want it to be our whole schedule anymore.  I want to feel like I'm being useful."
    "He gives me a look that says he wants to disagree and insist that me spending time with him is useful, but he seems to quickly rethink this idea."
    silver "Well then, I ah. . .I guess I should be going then.  Should I take Toffee with me?"
    alex "Don't be silly, why are you leaving?  It's after hours now-we're clear to goof off as much as we want."
    "His face immediately brightens and I feel a small weight being lifted from my chest.  Things won't be completely all right with me until I see the proof that he's willing to change things, but for now I'm willing to put my faith in him."
    "We settle down into our usual routine of watching a movie together, with Toffee splayed across our legs like some strange lapdog."
    "About halfway through, we're interrupted by a call.  It's my mother, of course, being the only other person I keep in contact with.  I give a sideways glance towards Silver Phoenix.  I'm not really sure what to do here. . .I guess I wasn't expecting it.  The call keeps ringing, though, so I have to make a decision."
    silver "Should I give you some privacy. . .?"
    "He starts to get up, assuming the answer is \"yes\", but I pull him back."
    alex "No. . .stay here.  It'll probably be quick."
    "He sits back down.  A lopsided grin is affixed to his face as he leans casually one of the armrests, one leg crossed over his knee."
    "I answer the call."
    mom "My goodness, Alex, I was just about to hang up!"
    alex "Sorry Mom, your call kind of took me by surprise.  What's up?"
    mom "Oh, I just wanted to call and catch up with you since it's been awhile, but I hope I'm not interrupting anything. . .?"
    "Her gaze lights on Silver Phoenix.  Although she tries to subtly redirect it, it keeps flickering back."
    "It occurs to me that this could be the moment. . .Silver Phoenix is right here-it would be uncomfortable to ignore or downplay his presence.  I could get out the truth once and for all. . .get it off my chest. "

    alex "It's okay, Mom-just hanging out with a friend."
    "Bad choice of words.  I see Silver Phoenix wince a little beside me, but I have to pretend I don't see it."
    alex "So what's new?"
    "I can still see the curiosity in her gaze as she tears it away from Silver Phoenix."
    "That doesn't stop her from launching into a full-update of everything I'd missed out on since we'd last talked.  Some of it is relevant to me, but a large portion of it is her talking about the friends of hers and relatives I barely remember.  She just loves to carry on a conversation, though, so I'm happy to indulge her for at least a few minutes.  However, it quickly  becomes difficult to ignore the elephant, or rather the Silver Phoenix, in the room.  He's not exactly huffing or acting annoyed, in fact he seems to be trying hard to hide the fact that he's upset at being left out."
    "My mother catches onto the tension and tries to wrap up the conversation much earlier than she normally would.  When she wishes me goodnight and ends the call after making me promise to call her soon, the room is filled with a heavy silence."
    "I decide to not let it stay that way."
    alex "I'm sorry, I guess I should have introduced you."
    silver "Don't worry about it.  Like you said, it caught you by surprise."
    alex "Yeah, but-"
    silver "It's fine, all right?"
    "But his body language seems to say that it's really not \"fine\" after all."
    silver "After all, I hurt you earlier."
    "I guess that's his subtle way of saying I hurt him too, just now. Ugh. . .maybe I should have gone for it. "
    silver "Come on, now, let's resume the movie."
    alex "Okay. . .are you sure?"
    silver "I'm certain."
    "I turn the movie back on, and we relax back into a comfortable position, but it's just not the same.  Every time I sneak a glance over, I notice that his mind seems far away. . .like he's thinking hard about something.  But what?"
    "I try to reach out and touch him tenderly. . .to get some sort of response out of him, but my efforts are dismissed in a gentle way.  He takes my hand and pulls it away, wrapping his around it to keep it firmly on the couch between us."
    "I can't tell if he's angry or sad or something else.  Not knowing feels worse than having him yelling at me would."
    "When the movie ends, he politely excuses himself, citing some other work he has to do.  If I had introduced him to my mother, would he have stayed?"
    "He leaves without a kiss goodnight, or any sort of lingering contact.  He takes Toffee with him, so he uses the excuse that his hands are full.  It's almost like he's glad to be gone.  But that can't be true, right?"
    "Ugh. . ."
    "I stretch out on the couch, arms folded beneath my head and eyes locked on the ceiling."
    "Something feels wrong here.  Should I apologize?  Should I just leave it be?  I can't let myself forget that he hurt me today, too, though."
    "I hope things will be better tomorrow."
    "Scene change to next day, still in alex's room"
    "I should be over at his place now.  It's time for us to be working-isn't that what I wanted?  But here I am, splayed out on the couch again."
    "[avatar_name] has already been by once to remind me of the \"scheduled appointment\" I was late for."
    "What's wrong with me?"
    "For some reason I just don't want to move."
    "Is it because I'm scared things won't change?  That he'll still direct me over to a table lavishly piled with sweets?  Or am I afraid that he's still angry or upset? "
    "Or is it something else entirely?"
    "I continue laying there, but for how long?  Minutes?  An hour?"
    "At some point, I hear someone enter the room.  I don't have to guess at who it is.  Silver Phoenix plops himself down on the end of the couch."
    silver "Rise and shine, sleepy."
    alex "I'm awake."
    "That came out sounding more gruff than I wanted it to."
    silver "Well if you're awake then what are you still doing here?  We've got work to do, remember?"
    alex "I do, I just. . ."
    silver "Are you not feeling well?"
    alex "Something just feels off."
    silver "Is yesterday still bothering you?"
    "I can't muster an answer."
    silver "Listen, I was going to save this for later, but I think you need it now."
    alex "What the heck are you talking about?"
    "He starts pulling me up by the hand, forcing me to sit up."
    silver "I want you to come with me.  I know I promised we would work hard today, but there's somewhere I want to go first.  I promise it'll be worthwhile and then we'll even work overtime if you want."
    "He tugs me up off the couch."
    alex "Where are we going?"
    silver "Just trust me, okay?"
    "He holds my hand tightly, and whisks us away to somewhere else in Virtuality."
    "I instantly recognize the place.  It's somewhere I've spent much time in, but not for a while. . ."
    "It's the arena where I spent many days and nights clawing my way to the top of the standings, all for a chance to fight Silver Phoenix.  A fight I never got. . ."
    "No one else is here."
    "What was he thinking bringing me here?  Even if it's what brought us together, the road there was a painful one for me.  It wasn't a good time in my life-why dredge up those memories?  Does he even realize?"
    "He lets go of my hand and turns towards me, arms outstretched in a \"ta-dah!\" motion.  He's beaming as though he's just presented me with the perfect gift."
    alex "I don't understand.  Why are we here?"
    "His smile starts to fall a little flat-not the reaction he was hoping for."
    silver "I want to give you what I denied you when we first met, to make up for how I've made you feel lately."
    "I feel inclined to turn the offer down.  After all, the version of me that wanted so desperately for that fight is entirely different from who I am now."
    "But. . ."
    "As he stands there looking so pleased with himself for coming up with the idea, that old desire is crawling out of the depths of my mind.  Suddenly I feel the urge to take a swing at him."
    "No. . .that can't be right.  I care so much about him, so why would I want to hurt him?"
    "I don't want to admit it, but. . .the more I think about it, the more I feel the insatiable need to fight him right here and now.  I want to hit him with all I've got, show him everything I've learned.  And I want to be the only one left standing."
    "He's staring at me, waiting for an answer."
    "Come on.  Just do it.  It'll be like therapy."
    "We can get all the hurt and anger out and then things will be good again. . .right?"
    "He's still standing there with that stupid grin on his face.  Is he just mocking me now?  Does he think I'm a coward who will just back down?  Is he trying to remind me that he's superior and always will be?"
    "No, come on, I know that's not true."
    silver "Well?"
    "But what if it is?"
    alex "Okay."
    "He nods and claps his hands as though this is the only answer.  The sound echoes through the empty arena."
    silver "This shall be the most stunning fight to ever take place in Virtuality."
    "We both take our places opposite each other on the fighting ground.  There are no fans to cheer and jeer us.  There's no officiate.  It must have cost a fortune to rent this place out during such a prime time for fights."
    "I can only stare at my feet as I don my fighting gear and summon my greatsword with a mere thought..  The weight feels alien now."
    "Am I really doing this?  Is this really happening?"
    "Any anxiousness is being rapidly replaced by zeal.  I'm champing at the bit.  I'm like a raging lion in a cage about to break free."
    "This is what I wanted, what I still want.  My wish is coming true.  Why doesn't this feel right?"
    "Something about this seems final.  I haven't wanted to hurt him like this in a long time.  It's almost like we've time-traveled right back to the start of all this.  The anger is suddenly fresh again."
    "We're both in place, one-hundred feet stretched between us."
    "There's no announcer, no countdown.  We simply lock eyes. . ."
    ". . .and start."

    "We move in the same instant.  I charge forward while he takes a graceful leap backwards into the air, his coat billowing out.  From his fingers fly bolts of lightning, but rather than trying to fry me, they attempt to snake around me, entrapping me in an electric web."
    "I'm an instant ahead of him; I dodge out of his \"net\" before it can surround me and continue my mad rush towards him."
    "Normally, a close-combat fighter wouldn't stand a chance against an expert mage-it's too easy to keep a physical fighter at bay until they tire or slip up, and I only have a few techniques to help me close the distance."
    "But I'd been preparing for this moment, making utterly destroying mages my specialty.  My only limit is my determination.  I just need to get close."
    "He tries again and again to ensnare me, but I edge my way closer.  All the while he's inching back, cold focus being his only expression."
    "The process is slow, but I'm closing the distance."
    "His bolts start hitting closer to me.  I can feel the heat now, but it doesn't hurt.  Is he hesitating to hit me directly, or just too focused on keeping me at a distance?"
    "I'm almost in reach.  His bolts start targeting my legs, trying to trip me up.  This is his best chance-I made certain to specialize my arena gear in reducing magic damage.  If he hit me directly it would hurt, but I could weather the pain for a few hits.  Once I got close enough to hit him full-force with my sword however. . ."
    "Well, even the most prepared magic-users I've fought couldn't take more than a handful of hits.  I'm certain that the great Silver Phoenix will be no different.  I could even bring him down in one if I did it just right."
    "II raise my sword and focus all my energy and excitement into it.  It begins to glow and blaze its own purple light."
    "A web of heated electricity forms between Silver Phoenix's fingertips.  It's propelled towards me, forcing me back like a wall.  It's surely different from real electricity, but it hurts like hell as I'm pushed back several feet.  I dig in and brace myself against the wall, trying to ignore the near-disabling pain surging through me."
    "I catch a glimpse of his face through the sparks; it's missing the prideful zeal I got so used to seeing on his face during a battle.  He looks almost reluctant to be doing this."
    "I keep pressing forward.  His wall is breaking, but I'm almost at my limit.  My body is convulsing; it's almost out of control.  Soon I won't be able to walk, let alone swing a sword."
    "No. . .I'm not giving up now that I've made it here. I CAN'T."

    "I clench my teeth and I make one final shove.  His net disperses with a great \"CRACK\".  I stumble through the now-empty space, panting, sword held low."
    "I start forward again and prepare my strike, but. . .my body is becoming so tired and my muscles are still convulsing from the electricity.  My body can barely coordinate; I'm struggling just to raise my sword above the ground.  Meanwhile, he's just standing there staring at me."
    alex "W-what are you doing?  Why aren't you attacking anymore?"
    silver "Alex, I know you really wanted this fight, but. . .I don't really like seeing you hurting.   I don't like being the one hurting you.  We're both clearly exhausted, why don't we stop here?"
    "There he goes again, treating me with kid gloves."
    alex "I don't want to quit! We aren't done yet-nobody's won or lost yet."
    "I swing my sword down on him with what strength I have left.  It's a clumsy slash, but he doesn't move fast enough to avoid it.  I see his surprised face as the hit connects with his shoulder.  He staggers and responds with another pinning shot of electricity.  I'm knocked flat on my back, my sword thrown from my hand.  I absolutely cannot move this time."
    "He comes to stand over me.  "
    silver "Does it really matter to you that much?"
    alex "Of course it does.  This is what I've been waiting for for years."
    silver "Yes, but. . ."
    "He's looking down sadly; I can't be bothered by this right now.  He heaves a great sigh."
    silver "Never mind."
    "He steps away and allows me a chance to get to my feet.  Why won't he just finish me?"
    "I try to stand, but all the strength has gone from me.  I can barely lift an arm off the ground, but somehow I manage to get myself into a kneeling position.  My whole body is trembling, threatening to collapse."
    silver "Alex, please, you've lost."
    alex "I'm still moving aren't I?  I can still fight."
    silver "I don't want to hurt you anymore.  I won't."
    "He takes more several steps backwards."
    alex "What are you doing?  Come back here and keep fighting!"
    "I still can't get fully on my feet; every time I try, my body just crumples."
    "He's turned his back to me.  He's walking even further away."
    "Any further shouts from me are ignored. Is this really what I spent all this time preparing for?  To be beaten down so easily?  Not only that, but to have him pity me too much to finish the match?"
    "I weakly beat a fist against the ground in frustration.  It's all I can manage."
    "How?"
    "How could I let this happen?  Was all that training not enough?  Have I wasted all these years on some stupid fantasy? Why did I even think our relationship could be anything but bitter rivals?-What sort of fog have I been caught up in?"
    "He's even further away now."
    "My vision is starting to blur.  All the pain I've endured is catching up to me.  A referee would have stopped the match by now in order to prevent strain on my real body. This match is over for me."
    "I close my eyes for a long second and inhale.  When I open my eyes again, he's gone-he's left the arena completely.  He isn't coming back; at least, not for awhile."
    "I close my eyes again and roll over onto my back.  All I can picture are the looks of contempt I received from both him and Alyssa that night. . .I guess I deserved them.  After all, I put so much time and effort into getting to this point all for. . .this-to learn that he's still better than me; that he always was."
    "Two roads stretch out before me: I could continue on as I have been, madly pursuing the chance to finally show him up, or. . .or I could give this up once and for all; I couldn't ask for a clearer sign than this. There's always another option, but to me it seems clear this time."
    "Well. . . "
    "I guess I finally got what I wanted, it was just different than how imagined it would be.  And now I have  my reason to end this foolishness. "

    "I finally tear through his barrier; it disperses with a great CRACK.  I'm hurting, but I don't allow myself to lose an instant.  If I stop, I won't be able to start again."
    "He's clearly tiring, but he's preparing for another attack.   I can't let myself take another hit.  I raise my sword high above my head and pound it onto the ground.  The instant it hits it sends a shockwave out in front of me, tearing through the ground in a straight line.  It hits his feet and sends him reeling backward for a moment-enough time for me to close the distance.  His fingertips are crackling with his signature \"firebolts\".  I have to be fast."
    "I take a swing at his shoulder.  He anticipates the move and dodges by a hair.  Damn it, I was so close!"
    "I don't wait for him to retaliate, though-I continue slashing away, throwing all the energy I have left into it."
    "He keeps dodging, moving with such a grace befitting of the name he chose for himself.  On my fifth swing I finally manage to catch him.  It's not the direct hit I wanted, but it's enough.  He stumbles."
    "I follow up with a full-impact hit to the side.  Skin or clothes are not torn in Virtuality fights, his body reacts as though it is a real hit, sending all the same pain signals.  He crumples to the ground taking shaky breaths.  It doesn't look like he's getting up anytime soon."
    "It's strange, but to see him lying there in pain and gasping. . .I don't feel bad.  I don't feel the desire to help him up or comfort him, or even to ask if he's okay."
    "There's only this feeling of satisfaction, like I got what I wanted.  I finally did it. I finally proved to him that I am strong and that I am remarkable-more so than him."
    "But that's not all.  There's also a feeling of finality, like I can be done with all this for good; and not just that I can, but that I want to."
    "I don't want to be here anymore."
    "What have I been doing these past few months?  Did I really try to convince myself that I would be fine without ever achieving this moment?  How foolish it was to try and stuff that desire down all for the sake of some \"relationship\" that just kept my head spinning in circles."
    "Maybe. . .maybe this is where it ends.  I can finally get back to living, even though I haven't got a clue what exactly I'm going back to.  It's time to restart; it's time. . .to give this up."
    "He's still on the ground clutching his shoulders.  His body isn't shaking anymore.  He starts to roll over, to turn towards me."
    "I decide that I don't want to see it-the forlorn look that practically begs to know why I can bear to hit him so hard and not even care.  It's time for me to go now, to make a quick exit.  A drawn-out good-bye just wouldn't be true to how I feel right now."

And Silver Phoenix. . .well, it's nice seeing him interacting with the other important half of my life: my family.  It's just a baby step for now, but it really means a lot."
    "The eventful phone call comes to an end as my mother wishes us both a good night.  We're left with a strange sort of silence-not an uncomfortable one, but one to digest all that just happened."
    "My gaze lies straight ahead, not really focusing on anything.  I feel a hand lightly wrap around mine before giving a reassuring squeeze."
    silver "I don't know what inspired you to do that, but I appreciate it."

    "I'm not mad, or even exasperated.  At this point, I've pretty much come to expect it."
    alex ". . .Nevermind, sorry."
    "He waves the question away as though it had never even been asked."

    alex "I think a part of me already knew that.  And maybe I overreacted a little, I don't know. . .I guess I've just been feeling a little lost lately."
    silver "What do you mean?"
    alex "Well, the money I earn from working with you, and the time we spend together are both very important, but. . .lately I've been feeling like I'm lost my drive to do something important.  I mean, this research is interesting and obviously means a lot to you, but, well. . ."
    "I'm not even sure where I'm going with this.  My thoughts are all a jumble.  So how can I expect to explain this to him?"
    alex "Before I met you, I had a plan-I was going to law school and I had my sights set on a high-profile career.  And then after we met, I had a plan then, too. . .I wanted to make myself better than you, to prove myself in a fight; it was a different kind of goal, maybe an obsessive one, but it was still important to me.  But now. . .I don't really know what I'm doing.  Everything in my life is still progressing, and I think it's for the better, but I don't really have a goal to reach for anymore."
    silver "I'm sorry, I feel like I took both those things away from you."
    alex "I think you're misunderstanding.  I'm not unhappy-really, I'm not.  I'm just feeling a little aimless right now and feeling like I was at least being useful to someone was helping at least a bit.  I guess I'm trying to apologize about before, too.  It wasn't just you."
    "He nods, but his thoughts suddenly seem to be elsewhere.  What is he thinking about?  I hope he's not still beating himself up over it.  I guess a little bitterness is still hanging in the air between us right now, but I don't want it to be that way."
    "He lets my hand drop and stands abruptly, a look of concentration on his face."
    silver "I apologize, Alex, but I have to cut our night short.  There's something I need to prepare for tomorrow."
    "I'm a little taken aback.  Maybe he just needs some space?"
    alex "Okay, but is it really that important that you have to leave right now?"

    "I quickly put an end to his shirt-nibbling and swoop him into my arms, laying down on my side with my legs stretched out.  Toffee wiggles a bit until he finds a comfortable spot cradled against my chest.  I decide to put on some mindless TV show to help me relax."

    alex "Well, you are the boss, so I guess I can't complain too much."

    "Regardless, we soon set about our \"work\".  This time I proudly show off to him my Toffee-piloting abilities and explain how it's done."
    "I'm ecstatic to see genuine amazement and fascination plastered across his face as all this is done.  He takes down many notes and even makes a few attempts at it himself; at first he fails and Toffee just wanders about as its usual self, but after a few tries and some coaching from me, he is also able to amble around in that clumsy giraffe-form.  And naturally, his first move upon mastering this new skill is to come up for a nose-to-nose nuzzle with me."
    "Even with all these things to do, he still finds time to cram new trials and experiments with Toffee into our schedule, plus a few other things.  After a while I'm able to convince him that it's okay for us to take a break every now and then, so long as we don't get carried away."
    "The day continues, and the entire time I can't quite shake the feeling that his excitement is meant for something else-something we haven't even gotten to, yet.  But what?"
    "After we've put in a full work days' worth of hours I fully expect that he'll want to relax in the usual way, but it seems this is not the case.  He's anxiously shifting from foot-to-foot, like he has something to say except he's too nervous to spit it out."

    silver "No, leave Toffee behind this time.  I don't want him getting in the way."
    alex "Getting in the way of what?"

    alex "No. . .wait.  I'm glad that you're willing to do this for me-it means a lot, but this isn't what I want.  I don't want to fight you.  I did once.  It was practically my whole life for a while. . . but that isn't who I am anymore.  I couldn't possibly want to hurt you.  Even the thought of it. . .I just don't like it.  Maybe some part of me thought I still wanted this, but standing here, having the opportunity in front of me. . . I realize it's the last thing I could possibly want.  Truly, I think the desire to do this has been gone for a very long time now, even if I didn't realize it."
    silver "Alex. . ."
    alex "I'm sorry.  I know how excited you were to do something nice for me, but I can't possibly accept this."
    silver "No, that's not it.  It's okay.  In fact, I'm kind of relieved.  I don't want to fight you either, but I was willing to bear it for a while knowing that it would make you happy.  But hearing that it's not what you want anymore. . .I'm glad. "
    "He comes to face me and takes my head between his hands, planting a light kiss on my forehead.  Even when he pulls back, we stay close like this, breathing each other in."
    silver "I wish I had a backup surprise for you, though!  I feel like I got us both all excited for nothing."
    alex "That's okay, really."
    silver "How about we get out of here and back to our regular routine, eh?"
    alex ". . .Wait."
    silver "What is it?  Would you like to go somewhere else instead?"
    alex "No, there's. . .something I think I want to say.  No, I know I want to say it.  I just hope I can get the words out."
    silver "What is it?  You know you can be direct with me."
    alex "I. . .um. . ."
    "Dammnit, it's like the words are hovering just outside of my reach."
    alex "Well, it's just that. . . being here with you has made me realize just how far we've come.  It wasn't that long ago that I finally met you, and yet it feels like I has a whole other person back then.  To be honest, I can hardly remember what it was like to want so badly to destroy you in battle, but I know that I did want that once.  Desperately.  And now. . .now all I want is to spend time with you-peacefully.  I enjoy your company in a way that I've never experienced with another person before.  You've become such a big part of my life in such a short time, and I still can't even begin to piece together how that happened.  It's been a whirlwind, but I'm glad that it all happened.  I'm glad that we're here."
    "My heart pounds as though it's rebelling against me, trying to break free from my chest."
    silver "I feel the same way, Alex.  I never expected things to go this way from the start.  Truly, it was a surprise, but I can't imagine what my life would be like if you weren't in it-other than it would be much more abysmal."
    alex "I guess what I want to say most is. . .I love you.  I want to be with you as long as I can. . .as long as you want me."
    "Not a second passes after the words escape my lips before he pulls me into a near-crushing embrace.  His chin rests on my shoulder, one hand pressing my head close to him."
    silver "Alex, I love you, too.  Please. . .stay with me.  I don't think you could understand just how much of a support you've been to me, even without meaning to.  Just having you near is enough."
    "His embrace does not relax for a long time.  He doesn't say anything more.  Neither do I."
    "We've said everything that needs to be said; everything else is simply understood.  I feel like we're finally on the same page here.  Everything is falling into place and I feel a sort of peacefulness.  Any doubts I had before are washed away.  I'm happy.  This is what I want-this is what I've chosen."
    "Not everything has been sorted out yet, but the rest will come in time-I feel confident  in that fact.  And even if my confidence is undeserved somehow, I know for certain that I'm happy right now, and that matters most."
    "He pulls away to look me in the eyes.  We hold each other's gaze for a long time as he brushes my cheek with his fingers.  He's smiling and his eyes are tearing just the slightest bit."
    "Yes, this is where I'm meant to be."
    "It seems strange to go back to our regular routine after such a momentous event, and yet it feels just like the perfect thing to do.  We return to my place and settle down for movie that turns out to be watched very little.  All the while, everything seems touched with an air of bliss and relaxation."
    "When we finally part, it's with the comfort of finally knowing what we were to each other, and excitement for all that lay in the future. . .our future."
    "Even after he's gone I can't stop grinning.  My heart won't calm, either.  All I can think about is what will be the next chapter for us-even the most mundane possibilities are enough to excite me right now."
    "I can't help but spend the evening in a whirlwind of thoughts and possibilities until my mind finally tires itself and I am able to rest."
    
    #TODO [scene change-sp's office]"
    "This time I'm the one to show up early.  I can't help it; the excitement still has its grips on me.  It's almost as though our relationship has had a new start-a sure start."
    "He's sitting at his desk, looking thoughtful but not working on anything in particular.  Upon noticing me, he looks overjoyed and rises to greet me."
    silver "Alex!  I didn't expect to see you so soon!"
    alex "I couldn't think of a better way to spend the morning."
    "He motions for us to go sit together and summons a pile of good breakfast-type foods along with two cups of steaming tea.  He's about to fall back into his chair and dig in, but pauses."
    silver "Oh, but if you'd like to get right to work, we can do that also."
    alex "No, this is fine."
    "And I mean it.  In fact, I really need moments like these."
    "We quietly eat.  Toffee is somewhere scuttling around the room, making more noise than the both of us.  It's a comfortable silence-a contented silence.  However, I can't help but notice his gaze getting further and further away as time goes on.  He munches on a piece of toast slathered in jam, but his expression gets evermore vacant."
    alex "What're you thinking about?  Can I know?"
    "He snaps back to attention as though he'd forgotten my presence entirely for a moment."
    silver "Sorry, didn't mean to get distracted."
    "He smiles as though to reassure me that everything was okay, but soon lapses back into silence."
    "I'm confident that he's completely spaced out on me again when he surprises me by speaking."
    silver "Alex, do you still think about us meeting in person?"
    alex "Of course. . .I mean, how could I not?  I just try not to bring it up anymore, since I know it's off the table."
    ". . .And I'm okay with that, I try to remind myself.  He makes a non-committal \"hmm\" noise and lapses back into silence for nearly a minute before speaking again."
    silver "But doesn't it ever worry you that, should we meet, I might be much different than you expect?"
    alex "I mean, I know it's a possibility, but the only way you could really be different is in appearance right?  Even if you looked different, I don't think I could care.  That's not why I care about you-I mean, how could it be?  I enjoy being around you, and it's not because of the way you look."
    silver "Yes, but it still might change how you feel somehow. . .You don't know for sure that it wouldn't."
    "I lean over and place my hands over his, looking him straight in the eye."
    alex "Yes, I do.  Besides, it's not like you could be drastically different, anyway.  Everyone just looks like their own self-image in Virtuality-no one can just look like a totally different person.  It's not like creating an avatar for a game or anything.  I mean, I know you know that."
    silver "Mm. . ."
    "Seriously, what's he worried about?  Is he older than he appears in Virtuality?  Younger?  Perhaps he's disabled somehow, or has a much different sort of figure than how he presents himself in Virtuality.  But even as my mind cycles through the list of options, I can't think of one that would be enough to deter me.  Our relationship is too important to me; he brings so much light to my life. . .how could I ever reject him based on a moderate change in appearance?"
    alex "But why are you even bringing this up, anyways?  I know this isn't something you want.  I've been trying for a long time now to make you feel comfortable enough to meet me and you've made it pretty clear you don't feel like you can."
    silver "Yes, I suppose. . ."
    "He flashes a nervous smile.  I hope I did something to put his insecurities at rest, although I can't help but wonder why he's even worrying about such a thing."
    "We soon get to work, but I can tell he's still a little distracted.  He keeps steering us back to the subject of appearances.  He doesn't seem unhappy, just. . .probing for something."
    "I know there's no sense trying to force it out of him-he'll talk when he's ready; that's how it's been so far."
    silver "Do you mind if we cut our experimentation a little short today?  I have a few rather important things that need taken care of."
    "As vague as usual.  I'll admit, I'm a little perplexed now."
    alex "I don't mind.  Did you want to stop here?"
    silver "Yes, if that's all right with you.  I'll also need some privacy for the rest of the day."
    "Perhaps I was wrong to think that we had things figured out.  He's confusing me, but I don't really feel like I'm in a position to pry."
    silver "I'm sorry if this is a little abrupt.  I can see you're worrying-I don't mean to cause you any emotional whiplash, I just need a bit of time to myself."
    alex "Okay, I understand.  After all, we can't smother each other by spending all our free time together."
    silver "Thank you."
    "I pull him in for a brief hug and kiss goodbye and then return to my own room.  I guess I'm a little unsure of what to do with myself now, but I'll manage.  There's a book I was in the middle of-I guess I could pick that up for a little while."
    ". . ."
    "\"A little while\"soon turns into four hours passing in the blink of an eye.  Heh, I always did have a tendency to get sucked into a good book.  Mom always used to complain that it was like I went deaf the moment I opened one up."
    "It's time to get up and stretch a little, maybe do something else."
    ". . .Oh, it seems I have a new message waiting for me and it's flagged as important.  I vaguely remember [avatar_name] mentioning it a while ago, but I guess I must have tuned her out.  Oops."
    "I sit down and take a look at it."
    "The sender is. . .Silver Phoenix?  Odd, why wouldn't he just come over say whatever it is?  I know he needed space, but this seems a bit silly.  There's nothing in the subject line."
    "A thought hits me as I hover over the message, just waiting to open it:  What if the contents of his message aren't good?  What if he didn't come over to say it because he couldn't bring himself to?"
    "Wait, why am I sitting here working myself up when I have the answer right in front of me?  Of course, once I know, there's no going back-good or bad; that's what's holding me back."
    "Oh come on, Alex, just do it, already."
    "I bite the bullet and open the message.  It takes my mind several seconds to comprehend the single line of text that awaits me:"
    "Meet me at Keystone Park tomorrow at 2."
    "No signature, no other explanation.  Nothing more."
    "Keystone Park. . .but that isn't just some location in Virtuality.  It's a real park and it's close to my house.  Is he really asking me to meet him in person?  Is this finally going to happen?"
    "I have so many questions, but of course he's made himself unavailable.  I can't even go to his office.  I know that it's in vain, but I reply to his message, voicing my confusion.  Of course he's not going to answer-not if he's determined to go about things this way."
    "Two o'clock tomorrow seems like an eternity away.  It's far too long for my heart to keep on pounding with excitement and anticipation like it is, and yet I know it will; it's too long for the butterflies to be fluttering in my stomach so, but I know they aren't going away, either."
    "I sigh and start searching for some way to distract myself as I settle in for a very long night."
    
    #TODO [end of scene, move to park]"
    "Relax.  Keep breathing.  Look casual."
    "No matter how many times I shift my position on this bench, nothing feels natural.  I thought this would be a good place to wait-after all, our relationship got off to its rocky start when he approached me on a bench in the middle of a park.  This time, it's in real life, though."
    "It's three minutes to two o'clock now.  I've been here since one, just hoping he'd show up early.  Really, though, I just couldn't sit still any longer to wait the full time at home."
    "Should I have brought flowers or something else romantic?  Does he even like flowers?  If he does, what kind would be his favorite?  Ugh. . .it's time like this that I'm reminded just how little I know about him."
    "I guess sweets would have been a safe choice, but it's too late now.  I don't think he'd be hurt by me showing up empty-handed, but I wish I'd thought to bring something earlier.  This is a big day.  This is what I've been wanting for so long, what I thought I'd never get."
    "I finally get to meet him."
    "One minute to two o'clock. . .is he dragging this out on purpose, or is he scared?"
    "He'd recognize me, right?  Of course he would, I don't look that different in Virtuality.  But to me, he could be any one of the people.  Maybe he's even been here this whole time."
    ". . .Or maybe this is all just fantasy and he's not really coming."
    "No, I can't allow myself to think like this.  He's not even late yet."
    "I pull up his information on my comm.  It says that he's not available in Virtuality, so his medical information is shown instead, just like we arranged.  Everything seems just fine.  Heart rate is a little high; I hope that's because he's on his way here and he's thinking about me."
    "The time ticks over to 2:01 and it's like a floodgate has opened to allow all the worried thoughts to rush through.  I still have hope, but now the fear is starting to overpower it."
    "I wait another ten minutes.  My fear is starting to shift towards anger.  Is he seriously ditching me?  After he got my hopes up like this?"
    "A hand lightly brushes my shoulder."
    qq "Excuse me. . ."
    "I turn my head.  There's a girl sitting on the opposite end of the bench.  The second I whip around, she shrinks back.  She's looking at me very intently and blushing."
    girl "Uhh, hi, I-"
    alex "Look, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm actually kind of waiting on someone important right now."
    "She looks stunned."
    "Of course she would be, I just completely cut her off.  This isn't like me, but I'm so on edge right now.  I just want him to show up and put an end to this farce.  I want the perfect day that I had imagined in my head."
    girl "The person you're waiting for. . .It's Silver Phoenix from Virtuality, correct?"
    alex "How do you know that?"
    girl "I know because. . .that's me."
    "My mouth goes agape."
    alex "Uh. . .what?"
    "It just doesn't seem true somehow.  I know we'd talked about different appearances but since when does he act so demure?  And I'd never heard of someone being able to change their entire gender in Virtuality.  She opens her mouth to try to explain, but I don't want to hear it."
    alex "Is this some kind of joke?  Did he send you to give me the bad news or something?  Was he too scared to come here himself?"
    girl "It's me, though.  I mean it.  Aren't you happy to see me?"
    alex "Did he pay you to say all this?  It's okay, you can stop.  I'm not convinced."
    "Ugh, this isn't how it was supposed to be!"
    "I slam a fist down on the bench beside me.  She jumps a little and looks away."
    alex "I can't believe he just chickened out like this!  And then to try and trick me by sending someone else in his place like I wouldn't know the difference. . .!"
    girl "Is it really that difficult to believe. . .?"
    alex "Of course it is!  People tweak the things they wish were different about themselves in Virtuality-they make themselves look better or a little different, but they can't just make themselves into a totally different person!"
    girl "Alex. . ."
    "She reaches out and places a hand on my arm.  I shake it off."
    alex "I get the message-he's not coming.  Please, just go away."
    "She breathes a quiet sigh and drops her hands into her lap.  I'm worried she's going to try again to explain everything away, but she doesn't."
    girl "Okay."
    "She stands and from the corner of my eye I see her walk off at a brisk pace."
    "The ambience of children playing in the park seems wrong in the context of this moment.  I wish I could just shut everything out.  This was supposed to be such a great moment, but now it's all gone up in flames."
    "Why would he do this to me?  Did the real him come to watch the travesty happen, or is he sitting comfortably in Virtuality, free of the burden of meeting me?"
    "I glance at the comm information, wiping away the angry tears welling at my eyes.  It says he's still out."
    "His medical information is still showing an increased heartrate-in fact, it's even higher now.  Breathing is abnormal, too; it's erratic and ragged.  It's almost like. . ."
    "No. . .it couldn't be. . ."
    ". . .Right?"
    "But the more I thought about it, the more I could see those same soft features that I had come to love so much present in the face of that girl; the subtle nuances in the way she moved. . ."
    "Was that. . .?  Could that have been. . .?"
    "Wait, what am I thinking?  That's not even possible.  But still, something's nagging at me. . .something odd is going on here.  I feel like I have all the pieces, but nothing is fitting together."
    "My comm emits a shrill \"beep\" alerting me to a sudden change in the data.  I look down, hoping to see that Silver Phoenix has calmed, but instead I see something very worrying: the data is gone."
    "What does this mean?  Is it turned off?  Have I been denied access?  Or. . .did something happen?"
    "I know it's probably nothing, but I'm starting to worry.  I can feel my own heartrate pick up and my blood run cold.   I don't understand what's going on, but I feel like I should catch up with that girl first.  She's the only solid clue I have right now.  And if it turns out she's somehow really. . .no, I need to get that ridiculous thought out of my head right now."
    "I stand, but I realize I only have a vague idea of which way she went.  However, the only thing in that direction was the elevated footpath that followed the river."
    "I start walking at a hurried pace.  What if I can't find her?  What if Silver Phoenix just disappears from my life forever, and all because of a stupid, bull-headed mistake?"
    
    #TODO [background change – a pedestrian bridge over the river]"
    "*pant* *pant* *pant*"
    "I've combed over the entire path on this side of the river, but no luck.  She could be gone by now.  My movements have gone from a fast walk to flat-out running in my growing desperation."
    "What should I do?  Should I try the other side of the river?  Somewhere else?  It seems so hopeless, but I can't just give up and go home.  I have to know that she's okay."
    "Damn it, I wish I had just shut up and listened!"
    "I lean over and try to catch my breath.  I'm not just winded from running all over-there's something else.  Something's wrong."
    "My chest feels tight; I feel trapped and suffocated despite being in the open air.  Even when my body's rested, my heart keeps pounding and breathing is difficult.  I want to run in any direction and also collapse where I stand at the same time."
    "What is this feeling?"
    "It's new, and yet. . .somehow familiar. Part of me says I've never felt this before, but some other nagging part remembers this feeling well."
    "What am I doing?  This is hopeless.  It's pointless.  All of this was a waste of time.  Why did I put myself out there only to let myself fall so far?"
    "All these questions in my head. . .they're like a massive weight descending down on me."
    "I'm crouched low to the ground now, head tucked against my knees and my arms wrapped around my legs.  My eyes are shut as I try to steady my breathing with no success.  And I'm. . .crying?"
    "This doesn't feel like me at all. . .to just collapse in on myself like this."
    "I'm sure people are staring-I can hear people whisper concernedly as they pass, but no one approaches me.  I feel so alone.  Surely if one of them stopped I would be released from this suffocating feeling."
    "I need to get up.  I need to be looking before I lose track of her completely."
    "It's starting to affect my senses now-images and sounds that I know aren't from around me are flashing through my mind.  I don't feel like I'm crouching, I feel like I'm standing-leaning against something,  Am I totally breaking down?  Am I losing my grip on reality?"
    "Wait. . ."
    "Is this. . .?"
    "Memories of our early experiments come to mind. . .when our thoughts and senses seemed to intertwine for a brief amount of time.  We'd never discussed any real-world applications-in fact, I don't think either of us had ever considered them.  We'd even shied away from the experiments after a while-though revolutionary it almost seemed to overwhelming and scary to take on the feelings of another person so completely. "
    "This feels too much like that time.  Is this what Silver Phoenix is feeling right now?"
    "If I keep my eyes closed and steady my breathing despite the barrage of fearful feelings. . .it's almost like I can feel Silver Phoenix's presence nearby."
    "I shakily get to my feet and wipe off my face.  I feel like I'm barely standing, but I   have to struggle through.  These feelings will lead me."
    "I start walking in the direction that I know will lead to the person I've come to care so deeply for.  Every step feels hopeless and my thoughts urge me to give up and forget all this.  But, I know that these thoughts are not wholly my own.  I would never just give up and run away, not when I can do something."
    "\"It's over\" my thoughts say, but I can feel myself getting closer."
    "\"It won't work\" –but I'm almost there."
    "\"Give up and forget about it\". . .But the figure I'm looking for is already within my sights."
    "There are so many questions in my head.  I don't understand how this could be, but I know without a doubt that this is the person I'm looking for."
    "She's leaning over rails of the bridge that goes across the river as a gentle wind whips up her long raven-black hair."
    "Just seeing her there brings me back to myself.  I'm still all worked up, but the feeling of being out of control and crushed by hopelessness has faded."
    "I start to walk towards her.  She hasn't noticed my presence yet, giving me the advantage.  But what do I even say?"
    "\"I'm sorry\" doesn't seem right.  I hadn't just hurt her feelings. . .I'd rejected her when I had promised yesterday over and over that nothing would make me do that.  Maybe it wasn't all my fault-I still don't understand how she was able to alter herself so much in Virtuality, after all-but it still wasn't right.  It was rash and unfair.  I was upset and I felt cheated, but that didn't justify it."
    "Ugh, I'm going around in circles in my head when really I should be saying all these things to her. "
    "But now that I'm here, just ten steps away from her, it's all gone-the explanations, the apologies, even my own questions.  All of it's gone."
    "Her comm is lying at her feet, probably discarded in anger."
    "All the things I want and need to say stick in my throat."
    "I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  I love you.  Please talk to me.  Don't go. "
    "There are so many complex ideas and feelings that I want to express, but somehow they all culminate into a single shakily-spoken word to get us started."
    alex ". . .Hey."
    "She turns around."
    
    #TODO [scene change, alex's mother's house #(epilogue)]"
    "We step into the house and close the door.  The little bell that hangs from the handle jingles to announce our arrival."
    mom "Is that you, Alex?  Dinner's almost done!  Come on over to the table once you get your shoes and coats off."
    "She's in the kitchen, the view of which is blocked from the entryway."
    fengsilver "A-are you sure this is a good idea?  Maybe I should just go and you two can have dinner together."
    "My hand is wrapped in the world's softest vice-grip.  She makes certain I don't get more than a few inches from her."
    alex "It'll be fine!  You guys met once already, remember?"
    feng "Yeah, but that was a phone call in Virtuality. . ."
    "I take a deep breath.  Dinner smells amazing."
    alex "I already explained everything to her, so it's okay.  She loves everybody, anyway.  Besides, I think she'd be more upset if we left just after stepping foot in the house."
    "She still looks unsure."
    "I pull her close and give her a reassuring squeeze."
    alex "If you really don't feel okay about this we can go."
    feng "No, I. . .I want to try."
    "She smiles back, but I can tell she'd rather it was just the two of us.  I'm glad she's willing to try, though. I know it's difficult for her, being in this sort of situation."
    "It's been difficult for me, too, getting to know this side of the person I love.  The difference between \"Feng\" and \"Silver Phoenix\" runs much deeper than appearances.  Out here in the real world, the cocky, self-assured and talkative person I came to know is actually very reserved and quiet.  The difference would be alarming if not for the fact that over time I've seen enough shared habits and tendencies two feel assured that they're the same person."
    "There are good reasons why it's like this, of course, but to be honest, I couldn't care less-For a moment in the park I had to deal with the thought that I might lose the person I love forever. . .  And now that that's over, I just want to focus on getting to know and love every side of them, even if it isn't always easy."
    alex "Hi, mom, sorry we're a little early."
    mom "Oh, don't you ever apologize for spending more time with your dear old mother."
    "She playfully pinches my cheek and then pulls me into a hug.  I put up a mock protest, but really, I miss things like this."
    mom "And it's so good to finally meet you in person, er, Silver Phoenix, was it?"
    "She looks down, intensely blushing.  She almost looks like she could cry.  Maybe this was a bad idea."
    alex "Um, you can just call her \"Feng\" now, Mom, okay?"
    mom "Feng. . . . that's such a pretty name!"
    "Mom's smiling at Feng, but she isn't looking back.  In fact, she's not even acknowledging my mother in anyway.  She's just fiddling with the comm on her wrist as though neither of us are there with her."
    "Meanwhile I'm gently trying to diffuse the situation by sending reassuring signals to everyone.  Feng doesn't mean any harm, she just has trouble with new people.  Still, I can see mom worrying she's somehow made a misstep."
    "I place an arm around Feng and mouth the words \"it's okay\" to my mother.  She still looks confused, but she at least picks up on the fact that it would be smart to keep things moving along."
    mom "Your father is running late as usual, but he said we ought to get started without him before everything gets cold.  All the dishes are out on the table, so why don't we go have a seat and dig in?"
    alex "Oh, Mom, I wish you had let us help out a little."
    mom "Nonsense!  It's not every day I get to cook for my little boy anymore, so I have to make the most of it.  Besides, if you two really want to help out, I'll stick you with the cleanup afterwards!"
    "Feng clutches onto my arm with a grip that would make a bird of prey proud as we move into the dining room to take our seats.  I can tell I won't be able to move more than two steps from her the entire night, but if that's what it takes to get through this. . .it's okay."
    alex "This looks great, Mom!  You really didn't have to go to all the trouble."
    mom "Nonsense!  Just make sure you two eat your fill and it will all have been worth it."
    "Feng's hesitant to touch any of the dishes.  Her hands are firmly planted in her lap, and I can see that they're shaking just a little.  Her mind appears to be off somewhere else.  I really hope that at least some part of this is good for her."
    alex "Here, let me make you a plate."
    "I gently pick up the plate in front of her and put a little from each dish on it.  I hope that there's nothing she dislikes because I know she won't speak up or refuse to eat it."
    "My mother is making up her own plate, but I see her concerned glances out of the corner of my eye.  Finally, I get myself some food while Feng slowly begins to take tiny bites."
    "Everything tastes great, as expected."
    alex "Geez, Mom, I don't think we've even made a dent in all this food."
    mom "Well, don't forget how much your father can eat!  I swear, sometimes I spend half my energy just trying to keep that man fed.  But enough about him-Feng, dear, why don't you tell me a little more about yourself.  We haven't had the chance to really talk, yet."
    "Feng's gaze remains rigidly ahead.  I'm sure she heard, but. . ."
    "Well, honestly this was what I was expecting for a first meeting.  I wish I had thought to prep my mother more, though."
    mom "Have I said something wrong?"
    alex "No, it's okay.  Feng just needs a little time. . ."
    "Underneath the table, I reach out and take Feng's free hand.  I give it a tight squeeze."
    "My mother nods.  I think she's starting to understand-or at least, as well as she can.  This behavior isn't exactly normal, but I've come to accept it as a part of who Feng is sometimes."
    "The conversation picks up again between the two of us.  Feng is physically there and probably keeping good track of the conversation, but one could be fooled by how little she acknowledges us."
    "It hasn't been easy-There's still so much we don't know about each other, after all, but we're getting there.  We have time."
    "There will always be roadblocks and things to shake our relationship, but we also understand how to start working past them."
    "I guess I don't know exactly what the future holds, but I can only hope that it's as great as what I have right now."
    "And for now. . ."
    ". . .For now I have Feng and I have my family, and things continue to get better every day."
    "I couldn't be happier."

    alex "Hey. . .could you come over here and sit with me awhile?"
    ai "Certainly, sir, but surely there must be some other way I can serve you besides sitting with you."
    alex "Something just happened and. . .I just really need to talk things out with someone right now.  Could we talk like we did that other time?  As friends?"
    ai "As friends?  Ah, yes, I remember your request to do so before.  Shall I resume that manner of speaking right now, then?"
    alex "Well, yes, but. . ."
    "I feel like her treating it like an order is sort of missing the point, but arguing it will probably get us nowhere.  I just want the anxiety to ease."
    alex "Nevermind.  Can we just start?"
    "She grins.  Her posture almost looks relaxed and natural for once.  Having someone else to focus on is already making me feel more relaxed."
    ai "So what is it you would like to discuss today, friend?"
    "It's so cheesy, I can't help but smile."
    alex "Well, it's actually about the job again."
    "Her relaxed posture changes and she leans forward, concerned."
    ai "Has it become more dangerous?  Have you been hurt?"
    alex "Woah, easy there, it's not quite like that."
    ai "So the danger has been resolved?"
    alex "Well, no, but. . .listen, there's something else about it I want to talk about."
    "She waits patiently while the words catch in my throat.  This is pretty awkward, but I'm sure it'd be worse if I were doing this with a real person."
    alex "What happened today was, well, um.  Well. . ."
    ai "I do not understand-why are you stammering so?  Has this incident damaged your ability of speech somehow?"
    alex "N-no, it's not like that.  It's just a little difficult to talk about."
    "She looks confused.  Of course she does-AI's don't get tripped up by things like embarrassment unless they're programmed to."
    "I take a deep breath.  Why am I getting so nervous, anyway?"
    alex "We, um, well we did have another incident, sort of like before and-"
    ai "Ah!  So there was danger."
    alex "Well, I guess that part hasn't changed much, but there's more to it than that, so please just listen."
    ai "My apologies.  Please continue."
    alex "This time Silver Phoenix saw something that made him wonder why I disliked him.  And. . . long story short, it somehow escalated into him. . .kissing me."
    ai "That seems highly inappropriate for a professional relationship-grounds to terminate all association, perhaps."
    alex "It is, but it's more complicated than that."
    ai "It seems quite simple to me, Alex.  Your employer has overstepped a boundary.  When combined with the fact that the experiments you two are carrying out have safety concerns, it seems that this is a very dysfunctional work environment that should be exited from immediately."
    alex "Well, when you put it like that it seems very cut and dry, but there are more factors involved, here."
    ai "What am I missing?"
    alex "For one thing, this job is still a necessity for me-I don't have any other way right now to make enough money to cover Dad's medical bills.  It's extremely important to me that I'm able to do this."
    ai "So if you had another viable source of income you might be willing to leave this job?"
    alex "I mean, I've never liked the idea of quitting something, but. . .I guess it would be the best thing to do.  It's not really an option right now, though, so there's no point in discussing it."
    ai "So you will be returning to work with him?"
    alex "I just. . .I don't really see any other choice."
    ai "I'm at a bit of a loss, Alex, as to what you wish from me.  You won't accept my suggestions to leave this job, and as your personal care assistant I couldn't possibly support your staying."
    alex "I guess I just needed to talk it through with someone.  When he kissed me I was pretty upset-I'm still pretty upset, actually, but having someone to talk to is calming me down some."
    ai "So simply talking the matter through, without looking for advice or solutions, is pleasant for you?"
    alex "Yeah. . .I guess you could say that."
    "She seems genuinely pleased that she's helping in some way, even if it doesn't seem logical to her."
    alex ". . .Anyway, I guess that even if I know I'll be going back, I'm still worried.  I mean, there's just no way I feel the same way as he apparently feels about me.  I mean, I can't stand that guy!  He's such an ass."
    ai "He might be an \"ass\" as you say, but if your work relationship is to continue he will have no choice but to accept that you do not return his feelings."
    "She seems reluctant to talk about anything besides me quitting, but I'm glad she's trying."
    alex "Yeah, I guess that's how I should go in, right?  I'll be firm with him, let him know that I won't accept this sort of thing from him.  Maybe we can just put this whole thing behind us, even, and go back to the way things were."
    ai "And if any further acts of indiscretions occur, you will be quitting, correct?"
    "I'm reluctant to commit myself to any action, but. . .no, she's right-I still have to be looking out to myself.  I can't keep ignoring the warning signs."
    alex "If something else happens, I'll quit."
    ai "And in the meantime, you'll start looking for other opportunities, won't you?"
    alex "Well. . . "
    ai "You yourself admitted that any other opportunity would be healthier, didn't you?"
    alex "I guess you're right.  I'm not confident that I'll find anything I'm qualified for that will have a high enough income, but I'll try, okay?"
    "She looks relieved.  It really is nice to know that I have someone worrying after me, even if she's an AI programmed for that sort of thing."
    "But really. . .is it normal for an AI to take such a prominent role in a person's life?  Most people just use theirs to help out with simple tasks; remembering appointments, sending correspondence. . .things like that.  Is it normal to treat one, or even need one as a friend?"
    "Ugh. . . now's not really the time to be thinking such complicated thoughts."
    alex "Can we talk about something else now, maybe?  Something lighter?"
    ai "Certainly.  What topic is best?"
    "Hmm. . .this proved to be a problem last time, too."
    alex "Are there any books you're familiar with, [avatar_name]?"
    ai "I can find a summary and discussion points for any book you're currently interested in."
    alex "Um, that's not. . .no, that's not really what I meant.  I guess I was asking if there were any books that you liked."
    ai "So you're looking for reviews, then?"
    alex "No, that's not really it either.  I guess you've probably never read one yourself, have you?"
    "Would an AI even stand to gain anything from doing so?"
    ai "It has never seemed a sensible use of time. . .simply scanning through words.  What can be achieved through that?"
    alex "Well. . .if it's a good story, then it's something fun to do.  You do know how to have fun, right?"
    ai "I know the sciences behind the human need for fun as a manner of stress-relief and achieving emotional well-being, but for myself it has never been a necessary thing to seek out."
    "In a burst of inspiration, I decide to pull up the data for a book I've read and reread many times growing up; it was just a simple fantasy story, really, but it was one of the first complex chapter books I ever completed, so it's always had a fond place in my heart."
    alex "Here, do you think you could try reading this sometime?  I want to know what you think of it."
    "I'm curious now as to where such an experiment will lead.  This might just be a waste of time, but. . ."
    ai "What I think?  If you're looking for more information on this book, I'm sure I could easily find it."
    alex "No, no searching information on the book.  I want you to try reading it and forming an opinion.  Will you try?"
    ai "I don't really understand this command, but I will try."
    alex "Well, I guess you don't have to, but I wish you would."
    "I'm fully expecting this to fail, but it would be nice to see her beat the expectation."
    alex "Okay, well, I think I need to get some rest now.  Thank you for talking to me-it was nice."
    "She still seems a little baffled, but also pleased.  I wonder if our conversations will keep evolving over time?"
    ". . .I really need to clear my head so I can get some rest.  Tomorrow I'm going to tell Silver Phoenix of my intentions for our strictly professional relationship going forward.  I have no idea how he'll take it; I guess I have no control over that.  I do have control over myself, however, and I know I can't allow myself to get so worked up again."
    "Okay."
    "That's it."
    "No more thinking about it for now."
    "Change of scene, still in alex's room]"
    "Ugh. . .how does one even write a message like this?  \"I don't have the same feelings you do, but I need money so please keep letting me work with you\"?"
    "Every time I type a sentence, I just delete it again."
    "There's just no tactful way to put this.  I have to make myself clear-He has feelings for me that I don't reciprocate; if I leave any ambiguity, he might think it's okay to try again.  But at the same time, I don't want to say anything that would make him put an end to our professional relationship as well. . ."
    "This shouldn't even be an issue.  Like [avatar_name] said, it was extremely unprofessional for him to even announce his feelings for me in the first place, let alone kiss me like that."
    "Knowing that I'm in the right doesn't make this any easier, though.  I can't even figure out an appropriate greeting line.  Starting off with \"Dear Silver Phoenix\", seems far too friendly.  Maybe I should forget the greeting and just dive right into it.  Even though I've calmed down by now, I recognize the need to be firm.  He needs to know that I'm the one with the high ground, here, not him."
    "I type out a few more lines and decide to test them by reading them out loud."
    alex "Silver Phoenix, what happened yesterday was an indiscretion on your part that overstepped your boundaries as my supervisor.  However, in the interest of continuing our professional relationship, I'm offering to \"forget\" this act and move past it, on the condition that you understand that your feelings are neither wanted nor returned by me.  Likewise, if any further unwanted acts occur, I will be resigning immediately."
    silver "Ouch.  Do you really have to put it so formally?  It's a little cold, you know."
    "I whip around in my chair.  Somehow, Silver Phoenix is standing there, bent over a bit to see the words I've written."
    alex "Forget why you're here, how are you even here?  You aren't registered as able to come and go here as you please-you shouldn't be able to just show up here."
    silver "Actually, I think the \"why\" is more important right now."
    "Of course, he's just dodging the question."
    alex "Okay fine, we'll play it your way-why are you here right now?"
    silver "I came to apologize, of course.  I felt it would be best done in person.  So. . .I'm sorry . . . About kissing you the other day, I mean."
    "He plops down onto the sofa, making himself cozy."
    alex "Well, duh, what else would you be apologizing for?"
    "He looks a little hurt by the vitriol in my voice."
    alex "Sorry, I'm still pretty upset about this. . .Anyway, look, I'm glad you feel the need to apologize, but more than anything I just want to forget that it ever happened. "
    silver "And you don't. . .want to quit?"
    "He seems genuinely surprised.  I guess he was expecting something totally different."
    alex "When it comes right down to it, I don't have any better options right now."
    "Maybe I shouldn't have admitted that."
    silver "Well, I'm glad to have you with me for. . . however much longer it will be. Er, professionally, of course.  It's been a pleasure working with you."
    alex "I really do mean it, though-if you try anything else like that again, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are, I'll won't be sticking around for an apology."
    silver "Right-of course.  I'll be on my best behavior going forward-I promise.  Can I ask one thing though, at the risk of upsetting you again?"
    alex "If you must."
    silver "That kiss. . .truly stirred nothing in you?  You're being honest with me when you say you don't at all return my feelings?"
    alex "Of course I'm being honest about it.  Why would I suddenly have feelings for you?"
    silver ". . .Of course.  Right."
    "He stands gets up, making ready to leave.  For once I can read his expression-he looks crushed, but he's trying to hide it.   It's only natural that he's upset; I just stomped all over his feelings, didn't I?  But it's not like it's my responsibility to feel something for him either, so it had had to be done, but. . ."
    "I can't help but feel a little bad.  He soon gathers himself, though, and his expression goes back to unreadable."
    silver "Okay. . .see you at our next scheduled time then, right?"
    alex "Yes, I'll be right on time, as usual."
    "With that, he's gone, but the room doesn't stay quiet for long.  [avatar_name] materializes in front of me the instant he is gone."
    ai "Sir, I didn't want to interrupt, but his appearance here was something of a concern.  You did not invite him here, did you?"
    alex "You were listening in on us?"
    ai "It's important for me to always be listening and watching so that I can best fulfil my duties as your assistant."
    "Well. . .she's got me there, I guess."
    alex "Well. . .you are right, I didn't invite him.  I'm not sure how he was able to just show up here on his own, and he didn't seem interested in answering."
    ai "With all due respect, I don't think this is something to be shrugged off.  Virtuality does not permit an individual to travel as he or she pleases into the private spaces of other users unless prior permission is given.  One cannot simply break these rules out of a desire to, it's a part of Virtuality's basic programming."
    alex "What are you saying?  He's working around the rules of Virtuality somehow?"
    ai "I'm simply stating that this, like his behavior, is cause for concern, Alex.  I know you wish to continue working with him, but I would urge you again to reconsider this."
    alex "I understand what you're saying, but I don't really know what to do about it.  I still can't just quit right now, and I don't really know what to do with information like this.  If I ask him about it, I'm sure he'll keep dodging the question."
    ai "Perhaps this is out of line for me to suggest, but you ought to at least report this suspicious behavior to Virtuality's security team for investigation."
    alex "And just go behind his back like that. . .?"
    ai "If there truly is no need to be concerned, their investigation will exonerate him.  However, it would be wrong to let this go unchecked if there is a possibility that he is somehow working around the rules of Virtuality."
    alex "Maybe if something really bad happens I will, but I really don't want to start something right now.  I mean, it's all just suspicion right now-nothing's actually happened yet."
    ai "Waiting until something happens seems like a dangerous approach, Alex.  What if what happens is actually quite severe?"
    alex "That's a big \"if\", [avatar_name].  . . .In any case, I'm not going to report him just now.  We're doing okay sorting things out on our own, I think."
    ai "You really ought to be more concerned about threats to your well-being.  I will be keeping a close watch for any concerning signs regarding this \"Silver Phoenix\"."
    "Coming from her that sounds a little ominous, but she's an AI so she can't really act beyond what her programming allows her to, right?"
    alex "I'm glad to hear you're so concerned for me, but do you think we could maybe talk about something else for awhile?  Something less stressful?  In fact, I'd really like it if we could just not mention anything to do with Silver Phoenix for the rest of the night."
    ai "Certainly.  In my idle time I have been studying casual human speech so that I might be better able to converse with you.  Shall I switch to that protocol now?"
    alex "Umm. . .sure?"
    "I'm not sure if I'm ready for what this entails."
    ai "So, pal, what is on your mind that's not related to the individual with the initials \"SP\"."
    "Well, she's trying. . ."
    alex "Well, coming up with something out of nowhere is kind of hard. . .I guess I don't really have anything in mind I want to talk about. . .um. . ."
    "Yeah, I'm stumped.  My mind's gone blank.  What can we talk about that she'll understand?"
    ai "There's currently a series of photos trending featuring cats dressed as historical figures.  Have you viewed these yet?"
    alex "No, I guess not. . .I haven't really had the time for silly things like that lately."
    ai "Viewing frivolous images and videos has been found to be an effective manner of stress relief as well as social bonding.  Perhaps it would be best to engage in such behaviors a little more often."
    alex "Maybe, but it doesn't sound very casual to say something like that, does it?"
    ai "Oh. . .right, sorry."
    alex "But you're right, though.  Thanks for looking out for me so much.  Why don't you show me what you're talking about right now?"
    "She looks positively delighted at this suggestion.  In an instant she has several screens of images pulled up and is exuberantly leading me through them as though they're something highly important.  She takes the time to explain the humor behind each picture, which happens to make them significantly less funny; I laugh anyway, though-partially due to the pictures, but also because I can't help but feel overjoyed at seeing her light up like this."
    ". . .Unfortunately, now that she's gotten going, I can't really get her to stop.  As much as I'm enjoying it, there's only so long that I can sit here and smile and laugh at the things she's showing me-and she's got the infinite well of the internet to draw from, so she won't be running out anytime soon."
    "Well. . .a little longer wouldn't hurt."
    #TODO [scene change- sp's office]"
    "\"Careful\".  That was the word of the day for the two of us.  Silver Phoenix didn't want to piss me off again, and I. . .well I didn't know what I wanted, but I definitely didn't want to give him the wrong idea. "

    "We sit in his cushy chairs with his usual tray of sweets and tea on the table between us.  He doesn't seem quick to get to work.  In fact, I'm almost certain he's stalling. We've been at this for an hour already-enough time for me to drastically slow on the amount of sweets I'm taking. "

    "It's not like I'm worried about gaining weight-I mean, this is just Virtuality after all.  But even if my stomach isn't physically filling up, my brain still knows how four cookies, an icing-lavished danish, and two cups of warm tea should feel and tells my stomach to give me a warning.  In other words, it's saying, \"no more, please\" in ways that are increasingly less polite."

    "The only reason why I'm still taking little mouse-like nibbles of cookies is to fill the uncomfortable silence between us while we both struggle to find a non-offensive topic.  Seriously, why does he insist on this?"

    silver "So how is your family doing, Alex?"

    "He asks the question very gently and takes a tiny sip of tea."

    alex "They're. . .all right, I think."

    "I realize I haven't kept in contact very well, despite doing this for them in the first place.  My mother's called several times recently, but always when I'm out, and I keep forgetting to return the call or it's just too late at night when I do remember.  What I never forget is to send a steady stream of funds over to her."

    silver "And your father?"

    alex "He's recovering, but he still has to check in with the doctors regularly.  Mom's still pretty worried about him, I think.   I don't think she'll ever be able to stop worrying about him now-we didn't really see this coming."

    silver "Not at all?"

    alex "No, I mean, he's a little heavy, but not fat.  And there's no family history of it either. "
    "I guess the smoking didn't help, but come on, a lot of people smoke and never end up in the hospital.  It's. . .just not something you think about unless it happens."

    silver "I suppose not."

    "He picks up a cookie and brings it to his mouth, but if he takes a bite, it's an impossibly tiny one.  When he sets it back down on a napkin beside him, it looks almost untouched."

    alex "So, uh, we gonna do some work today?"

    "I'm getting a bit sick of his stalling tactics, but still I try to keep a light tone with my inquiry. "

    silver "Yes."

    "He pauses to take another \"sip\" of tea."

    silver "Eventually, anyway.  What's all the rush about?"

    alex "No rush, it just seems a little silly for you to pay me to sit here drink tea with you."

    "This feels like a pretend tea-party –where all the drinks are just imaginary, so they can never technically be gone, so it never ends."

    silver "Good companionship is priceless, Alex.  I don't think it's silly at all."

    alex "If you say so.  I guess I shouldn't be complaining if I've got it this easy."

    silver "Indeed.  I think I could find a sitting companion for free if I wanted to."

    alex "Yeah, I guess so.  I don't think your fanbase has gotten any smaller since you quit.  I'm surprised they haven't figured out how to find you already."

    "I wriggle into the chair a bit further, since it didn't seem like we were going anywhere anytime soon. \"Careful\", I remind myself.  I keep my body in a reserved position, arms and legs pulled back."

    alex "So why not pluck up one of your adoring fans for this instead of me?"

    silver "Because they're not who I want to talk to."

    "I choked a bit on the sip of tea I'd just taken.  Geez, why's he gotta say things like that?  He quickly corrects himself, though, seeming to recall our unspoken creed to be \"careful\"."

    silver "I mean, all they'll do is just sit here and gush.  Fun for them, but. . .well, not so much for me."

    alex "I suppose not.   I'm kind of surprised, though.  Usually you're pretty eager to get to work.  I thought we were kind of on the verge of a breakthrough last time, don't you?"

    silver "All the more reason to take it-er, the experiment, slow.  Don't you think?  I don't think we'll work well under the pressure of such expectations, don't you think?"

    alex " Maybe not, but that's never stopped us before."

    "I could see that it was more than just wanting to talk that was keeping him from wanting to work.  There was something else there-maybe fear.  Maybe he was afraid of what could happen this time.  What other private thoughts could be shared by that sudden spark of closeness?"

    silver "Don't worry yourself about it, Alex.  You're getting paid either way."

    "I sigh and slump in my chair a little.  I guess I wasn't really eager to get back to it either. Not after what happened last time."

    silver "Besides, you were the one who thought this was ridiculous and not worth the time."

    "I can tell that he senses the tension starting to rise again.  He's trying to change the subject."

    alex "I mean, it's cool, but I think that there's easier ways out there to improve Virtuality."

    silver "And is the easiest prize usually the one most worth it?"

    alex "Well, no, but I was just thinking that there are a lot of little improvements to be made that I think people would really appreciate."

    "He sits back and sighs, but doesn't look as disappointed in me as he normally would.  In fact, he smiles just a tiny bit-and not a smirk, either.   I think he's slowly growing fond of my ignorance towards his endeavors."

    silver "There are thousands of others capable of and perfectly willing to pursue those, and I'm sure that they will be attended to eventually, but there are very few who could see the full potential of what we're doing here; and despite your arguing to the contrary, I firmly believe that you are one of them."

    alex "Geez, man, I don't know.  I mean-"

    silver "Alex, have you ever taken a moment to ponder just how incredible the human mind is?"

    alex "What?"

    silver "Think about it-think about all the things that can happen just in your mind.  You can picture things without even seeing them; you can hear sounds, and even recall tastes and smells.  I mean, all that without actually experiencing these things.  You can even imagine entirely new things within it."

    alex "I guess that sounds pretty cool when you put it that way."

    silver "But now imagine that happening between two different people, but combined."

    alex "You've been preaching that to me this whole time, but I'm just not sure if I believe it."

    silver "Well, I suppose it's good for one of us to be a skeptic here.  I really don't mind it.  I think it grounds me a little.  Otherwise my head might be completely in the clouds-but it would still be nice if you could see things a bit more as I see them.  Perhaps you will when we succeed at what we're doing now."

    alex "Well, we never will succeed if we don't ever get to work again."

    silver "Have some patience.  Losing a day of work won't ruin things."

    alex "So you really don't intend to work today, do you?"

    silver "Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag,"

    "He says this with the most nonchalant expression, not the least bit disappointed by having his \"secret\" ousted."

    alex "Seriously?  This is kind of ridiculous, don't you think?"

    silver "I feel as though we're talking in circles.  Can't we tread some new ground?"

    alex "Yes, we can-if we go back to what I'm actually here for."

    "He just sort of scoffs at me in an irritatingly jovial way and hides behind his tea cup."

    "I eventually get him up out of his chair and onto doing some experiments, but. . .things feel sort of half-hearted and distracted on both sides.  Even so, it tires me out pretty quickly.  It's not long before we're just milling around the room lost in our own thoughts."

    "I reach out and fiddle with some of the things on his shelves.  Everything in here was created by his own imagination. . .I could never make something like this.  Not even close."

    "I surreptitiously glance his way.  He's plopped down in his chair again, propping his head up on one arm, eyes closed.  He's definitely not asleep-he looks too restless for that."

    "He's probably feeling a bit hurt by my refusal to return his feelings.  Even if I don't condone what he did, I can sympathize with him a little; rejection always hurts, after all.  And I'm sure he really was being genuine about his feelings-or at least he believed he was."

    "I, on the other hand. . . Well, I guess I'm not really sure what's wrong with me right now.  Either way, today seems like a dud."

    alex ". . .I think I'm going to go for now.  Is that okay?"

    "He doesn't really reply, just makes a soft \"mm\" sound as confirmation and slides into the seat at his desk."

    "Yeah. . . It's time to get out of here for today.  I want to reach out and say something, but I'm not even sure what would be useful.  It's probably better if I don't."

    "Maybe tomorrow we can get back to normal."

    #TODO [scene change- alex's room]"

    "Of course, [avatar_name] is there waiting for me the moment I enter the room."

    ai "You're home early, Alex.  How was everything at work today?"

    "She usually asks me this, but today it's with a different purpose.  There's suspicion in her tone."

    alex "Everything was okay-Well, as okay as things can be expected, all things considered.  It was a little awkward, I guess, but I think things will get better after some time has passed."

    ai "So nothing particularly concerning happened?"

    alex "No, he's keeping his word so far."

    "She looks almost disappointed that things went so well."

    ai "After I completed the tasks you assigned me this morning, I had some free time to start looking further into the identity of this person you're working with."

    alex "Wait, what?  I never asked you for anything like that."

    ai "I thought it might aid any investigation that might take place if we knew more about him.  In the process I learned a few facts that may be of interest.  Shall we discuss them?"

    alex "I appreciate your efforts. . ."

    "even if I didn't ask her to do anything..."

    alex ". . .But I just came from there.  I really don't want to think about Silver Phoenix anymore today."

    ai "As you wish."

    "Again, she looks frustrated, but she doesn't push the issue."

    alex " I know, I know.  I said the same thing last time, right?  I promise we'll discuss it if something major happens."

    "She looks a little happier, but I still need to find something to lighten the mood. . ."

    alex "So, um, have you tried looking at that book I showed again?"

    ai "I parsed through it two more times, but to do so any more than that seems an inefficient use of my time.  I don't seem to be achieving what you desire from doing so.  In fact, my failure to do so seems to upset you significantly."

    alex "It's not your fault, really.  I wish I could help you understand better, though."

    ai "Why is it so important to you that I understand the joy you find in reading a book?"

    alex "Well, it's not just about reading books, but it seemed like a good place to start.  I just wanted to see if you could experience it the way humans do.  . . .sorry, it seems a little wrong now that I say it out loud.  I feel like I'm treating you like a science experiment."

    ai "I don't mind, Alex.  It's my duty to help you however possible."

    alex "See, that's the sort of thing I mean.  Sometimes I wish you minded a little more."

    ai "Shall I be less complacent in the future, Alex?  Will that make my behavior seem more human to you?"

    alex "I appreciate you trying, but. . . I don't think it means much when it's something I told you to do."

    "I sigh and put my head in my hands.  I feel like there's gotta be a better way, I just haven't found it yet.  I'll just have to keep trying."

    "She comes over and gives me a little pat on the back.  Her delicate hand lingers there."

    "The physical feeling of her hand resting there and the warmth that comes with it. . .it's comforting, but my mind can't help but keep circling back-wondering if this comforting gesture is just another part of her programming."

    "Even if it is, so what?  Does that cheapen it?  Make it any less comforting?"

    "I don't move for a long time and eventually I feel her hand lift.  She leaves the room.  I wonder briefly what she's up to, but really I can't stop thinking about how nice her hand felt resting on my back like that."

    "What am I getting myself into?"

    #TODO [scene change-sp's office]"

    silver "What's on your mind?"

    "I jump a little.  I wasn't expecting him to speak."

    silver "You haven't been right all day.  We can't progress with our work until you get your focus back."

    alex "I don't know, I don't really have any well-formulated thoughts right now."

    "We were actually trying to make some progress on the experiment today, but our results were nowhere near where they had been before."

    alex "Do you really think that anything'll come of it?  I mean, we were doing pretty bad earlier. . ."

    silver "It's better than just sitting here agonizing over these things."

    "We return to our growing pile of today's failures, lumps of indiscriminate matter covered in muddy colors.  He keeps trying to simplify our experiment to make it easier, but it isn't helping."

    silver "Don't worry about the type of paint.  Or even the surface-don't even think of it as a canvas.  Just surface and color.  That's all we need to think about.  I'll make a vase, and you make some flowers.  One image.  It's cliché as all hell, but it should be simple enough to work."

    "I'm sure he's probably dying to try out some of the new things he's discovered. . .like getting into each others' heads, but I think we both know that's a dangerous game to play.  Right now we both could use a little simplicity.  There's still more to explore here, it's just a tamer beast. "

    alex "We've been trying \"simple\" all day, and it hasn't been working out."

    silver "Yes, I suppose you're right.  I thought that articulating it might help, though."

    alex "I have a feeling it won't."

    "He looks downward and shuffles his feet on the floor, seeming to be unsure of what to try next.  It's clear this isn't working-not right now, anyway."

    "A sudden thought seems to appeal to him. His eyes widen as if some muse has begun to whisper in his ear."

    silver "You know what?  Let's try something different.  Let's be loose.  Forget simple.  We'll both think of something new-anything, I don't care what it is, and don't tell me either.  Let's create something fantastic; forget about perfect for a minute, just make something."

    alex "I don't understand-Isn't that what we've been trying to do all along by making these paintings together?"

    silver "Yes, but this time we're not going to make something real.  We're going to make something unreal.  This is Virtuality we're in, remember.  We need to be pushing boundaries, not tiptoeing up to the ones that already exist.  It doesn't matter if it's perfect or like the things we already know, because it will be our own invention-there's no right or wrong there."

    alex "But if we can't even do something as simple as this.  How are going to create something even better?"

    silver "Well we won't know until we try, so how about you do away with all the questions and the negativity for a moment and give it a good, honest try?"
    "On the count of three, like always.  Ready?  One. . ."

    alex "W-wait, wait, wait.  I'm not ready!"

    silver "Two. . ."

    alex "Hey, hang on a minute!"

    "He's intent on ignoring me and instead flashes a mischievous smile."

    "I panic a little.  He said think of anything-but that's a whole lot of things I could think of!  I latch onto the first thing that comes to mind and roll with it; it's not exactly imaginative, but it's all I've got!"

    "I feel his mind reaching out to me, trying to make the connection we need to form whatever this is going to be.  A tie between our minds is forged.  I have some vague feeling of what he is thinking of, but it wasn't a complete image.  Something blue."

    silver ". . .Three!"

    "Finally, there is a decisive \"now\" moment between the two of us, and together, we propel the two images from our minds and into Virtuality space."

    "I hear something clatter to the floor as the feeling of mental strain from the connection begins to disappear."

    "I feel a tap on my shoulder.  I was still standing there with my eyes closed, feeling a bit out of it."

    "But when I feel his hand gently touch my shoulder, I open my eyes.  He gives me a curious look before grabbing my sleeve and pulling me over to the results of our latest effort.  He holds out his free hand with a flourish, as though a game show host revealing the grand prize from behind a curtain, with an appropriately cheesy smile on his face and wide eyes awaiting my reaction."

    silver "Well, what do you think of our little creation?"

    alex "Just what is it?"

    silver " Well, it's exactly what it looks like, I suppose."

    "He says, not sure what to make of it either.  But he looks pleased."

    "\"It\" certainly is interesting; it stands at just around two feet tall and is a translucent blue, with a texture like blown glass.  And its form could only be described as a cartoonishly long-necked giraffe with a gentle face and papery wings far too small to be functional sprouting from its back.  But none of these things seems strange compared to the fact that it appears to be living.  Its sides appear soft, despite being transparent like glass, and expand as it breathes.  It walks around on its knobby legs and prances at our feet like a puppy."

    alex "Why's it like that?  Why's it moving?"

    silver "Because I wanted it to.  Just like you wanted it to be a giraffe.  By the way-a giraffe, Alex?  You have the opportunity to think of anything in the world and that's what you come up with?"

    alex "Hey come on, you didn't give me any time to think!"

    "He smiles and puts his hands on his knees, bending down to be almost on the level of the creature.  It immediately approached and propped its front legs up on his knees to meet him nose-to-nose.  This thing was too cute for its own good."

    silver "Well at least I thought to restrict its size a little; I didn't really need a giraffe bursting through the roof.  Were the wings your doing?"

    alex "Yeah.  Kind of stupid, I guess."

    silver "Only in that they're far too small for it to use them."

    "He gently holds one of the wings between his fingers and unfolds it, studying it intensely."

    silver "It looks like paper but feels soft; almost like a flower petal. . ."

    "He's murmuring to himself; I wouldn't be surprised if he had forgotten my presence."

    alex " So. . .do you think we've accomplished anything by doing this?"

    silver " Oh, absolutely.  I mean, look at this-this isn't just some object from real life we've managed to recreate.  It's a unique thing that no one else has seen before.  More than that, it's a combination of our own imaginations.  Just think-if you had the opportunity to be a little more creative, think of all the things we could make by combining our own independent thoughts.  I can't even really imagine all the possibilities because they aren't possible all by myself."

    "I can't help but smile when I see just how excited he is over this.  He picks up the creature in his arms, cradling it like it's an infant."

    silver "Come on, I think that's more than enough today.  I want to celebrate this success."

    alex "Wow, I'm surprised.  Normally you're so eager to keep moving onto the next thing.  I would have thought that after such a success, you'd be pretty much insatiable."

    silver "No, it's good to celebrate triumph.  What meaning is there in it if we just raise the bar and continue on?  We need to stop and enjoy this success before we keep climbing."

    alex "I suppose you're right.  Besides, I'm not one to complain about being done with work for the day."

    "I think that we were both also afraid that should we continue it might not happen again; that next time the results might be a huge mess.  We both realize that we should revel in what just happened before we try to reach higher and must suffer through many failures once again."

    "We walk together, him still clutching the wriggling creature like a teddy bear prize just won at a carnival.  He plops down into a chair at his table and stuffs a cookie halfway in his mouth and breaks it in half, offering the rest to our new little friend."

    alex "How does it act like it's alive?  Does it have some kind of AI telling it what to do?"

    "I seat myself next to him, rather than at my usual place across or a chair down from him.   He is forced to take a bite of the cookie before he can respond."

    silver "I'm not sure.  It must, I guess, since we're in Virtuality.  But usually something as lively as this needs to be preprogrammed in after a great deal of work. I just tried to imagine something acting happy and cute without really giving it a shape in my mind."

    alex "What if I had thought of an object instead of an animal? Would it still act like it's alive?"

    silver "I'm not sure.  We'll have to experiment more to find out.  My guess is that that directive of how it should act might be interpreted other ways-maybe figured into its appearance somehow, making it look vibrant, or playing a nice tune, or something."

    "He continues to play with it, letting it prance around on the table and nose through our sweets.  He even lets it take a few draughts from his cup of tea, but I notice he himself does not drink from it after.  I've never seen a giraffe in real life, but I don't think they would act like this; this creature acts more like a puppy in my opinion.  Meanwhile, Silver Phoenix is cooing after every little thing it does."

    "It's cute, but I don't really know what to do with it, so I just go back to examining the room.  I get to thinking about the rows and rows of books on shelves that line the room.  He could practically run a library with all of these.  But. . ."

    "Well, when I think about it, it really is amazing-the physical forms of these books are created and maintained by his own imagination as well.  To imagine a book as it would be in reality. . .how one is structured and its pages filled with content. . .that's not something just anybody can do once, let alone on such a grand scale."

    alex "Hey, why do you keep all these books around like this?"

    silver "Because I enjoy reading.  Why else?"

    "He barely looks up from the giraffe-creature, which he's coddling like a baby now."

    alex "Well, yeah, but why not just keep them in a data format so you don't have them cluttering up the place.  I mean, I like reading too, but surely you could fill this room with something more interesting than just books."

    silver "Perhaps, but I really enjoy being able to see and hold a book in my hands.  Reading text off a screen is okay, but to be able to flip through the pages, touch the covers. . .It's pleasant.  I would feel there was something missing otherwise.  I like also being able to see all the books that I have read and all the ones that I will read being gathered in one place."

    alex "Hm. . ."

    "Maybe. . ."

    silver "Something on your mind, Alex?"

    alex "Could I maybe. . .take one of these with me?"

    silver "Oh?  Decide you want to give it a try?  You're certainly welcome to take one."

    alex "No, I've never felt sentimental this sort of thing.  It's for a friend.  I think they may benefit from trying this sort of thing."

    silver "Surely your friend has held a real book before?  it's really not any different in Virtuality."

    alex "No. . .I don't think she knows what it's like."

    "Silver Phoenix gives me an odd look, but he doesn't pursue this line of questioning any further.  It's probably for the best.  I mean, how could I explain to him that I'm trying to evoke original thinking in an AI program?  With my luck, he'd become fascinated by the idea and start butting in with his own ideas.  This really is kind of crazy, but I'm interested to see if giving her a physical book to hold and flip through will make it any different."

    "I pick out one that seems like it would suit her-it's a mystery of some sort.  I don't really know it, but it's hard to find anything amongst Silver Phoenix's collection that isn't nonfiction.  I hold it up."

    alex "Hey, is this one any good?"

    silver "Would I keep it in my collection if it wasn't?"

    "Does he have to be such a smartass about everything?"

    alex "Seriously, though, is it good?"

    silver "It has an intriguing plot and a surprising twist ending, if you like that sort of thing.  It even fooled me, and I'm pretty good at figuring out mysteries before they're solved."

    "Hmm . . .Maybe a mystery like this would be good.  It has a logical buildup that's different from other genres-maybe this would work well for an AI?"

    "I tuck it safely under my arm."

    silver "So who do you think should hold onto this little scamp?"

    alex "Uh. . .pardon?"

    "He holds the giraffe-thing up to me."

    silver "Well he's got to stay somewhere."

    alex "Can't you just wish him away, or something?"

    "He looks genuinely shocked at this statement."

    silver "Why would I want this sweet little thing to go away?-especially given how it was created?  I don't think we could ever recreate something exactly like this, Alex; don't you see how special it is?"

    alex "It's definitely really cool, but are you going to hang onto every single one of our experiments from now on?"

    silver " I'm sure I can find a place for them all."

    "He's not kidding at all.  I sigh and try to smile."

    alex "Well, it seems to make you really happy, so why don't you hold onto it?"

    "He nods with an eager grin, and I wonder if this was the right answer all along."

    "I shrug with a smile, as if to say, \"suit yourself\" and consider the matter settled."

    alex "Well, I suppose that's it, then.  That's it for the day, isn't it?"

    silver "Oh. . .yes, I suppose that we're done with work for the day."

    alex "Great.  I'm going to take off, then."

    silver "Sure."

    "He says this quietly.  I get the feeling he doesn't really want me to leave, but what good could possibly come from me staying?  I don't want to give him the wrong idea or anything.  Hopefully he has someone else he can spend some time with besides me.  Maybe we can hang out some other time."

    "But for now. . ."

    "I return to my own room, trying not to let myself get too bogged down worrying.  I mean, why should it matter to me, anyway?"

    "[avatar_name] is there to greet me, as always."

    ai "Hello, Alex, how was work today?"

    "Of course, she's still hoping for some news that it went horribly."

    alex "It went well-we actually made some progress."

    "She doesn't bother to hide her disappointment in the slightest."

    ai "Oh?  Of what sort?"

    "I explain to her about the little giraffe as best as I can, but to be honest, I don't understand it very well myself and soon find myself trailing off."

    ai "An interesting result, but are you certain this is really worth your time?  Weren't you expecting to be completing more monumental work when you first joined his project?"

    alex "He seems to think it's an important step on the way to his goal.  And I don't really know enough to discredit that idea. . .Besides, I don't really care as long as we're accomplishing something."

    "She sighs loudly and shakes her head-it seems like she's getting more and more bold in expressing her distaste for anything to do with Silver Phoenix each day."

    alex "Anyway-I brought something back."

    "I hold out the book in front of me.  She looks down at it, perplexed."

    ai "Oh . .shall I find a place to put this?"

    alex "No, it's for you to look at-well, if you want to, that is."

    "She takes it from me and holds it stiffly in her arms.  Unlike a human, she doesn't feel a compulsion to rifle through the pages or look at the cover."

    ai "And you would like some sort of report on the contents?"

    alex "No, I-"

    alex ". . . Hold on a moment."

    "I gently take the book from her and stand so that we are shoulder-to-shoulder."

    alex "Just take a moment and look at it.  See?  The art on the cover's pretty neat, isn't it?"
    ai "Yes, the artist's name is-"

    alex "Don't worry about stuff like that right now.  Just look at what's here.  It's called And Then There Were None.  Sounds pretty mysterious, right?"

    ai "It was written by Agatha Christie, published in the year 1939, and sold-"

    alex "--Uhh, let's just move on, okay?"

    "I feel bad cutting her off, but once she starts rattling off information, she doesn't stop until there's nothing else to report.  I flip back the front cover and play with the pages between my fingers."

    ai "Doesn't looking at the pages rapidly and out of sequence make comprehension difficult?"

    alex "I'm not really reading right now.  I'm just sort of looking at it.  Here, why don't you try holding it again?"

    "I hand it back to her, making sure it stays open.  She seems unsure of what to do."

    alex "Well. . .why don't we try actually reading it now?"

    ai "All right."

    "She turns to the beginning of the story.  No more than a second passes before she turns to the next page-and then the next and the next.  I'm a little stunned, but it makes sense that she can parse through text that fast.  In less than a minute she's made her way through the first chapter and a half.  I place a hand over hers so she can't keep going."

    alex "Hold on."

    ai "I'm sorry.  Was I doing it incorrectly again?"

    alex "You were definitely reading it, but that wasn't really what I had in mind.  Uh. . .do you mind if I take this back again?"

    "She surrenders it easily.  I turn it back to the first page and take a seat over on the couch."

    alex "Come on, come sit with me."

    "She takes a seat on the opposite end, taking up a rigid position.  It's not that she's uncomfortable-looking relaxed just isn't her thing, I guess.  I myself get comfortable and hold the book so that she can't see the words.  She eyes me suspiciously, probably trying to calculate what's coming next."

    "Well. . .it's actually pretty simple.  Giving her this task to do on her own hasn't proved very effective so far.  So why don't we try it together?"

    alex "I'm gonna read some of this out loud, okay?  So just listen for now.  And if you get bored and want to stop, let me know."

    ai "Bored?"

    alex "Right-nevermind.  Let's just start.  Oh-and no looking anything up while we're reading or you'll spoil it."

    ai "Understood!"

    "Here we go. . ."

    alex "In the corner of a first-class smoking carriage, Mr. Justice Wargrave, lately "
    "retired from the bench, puffed at a cigar and. . . "

    "I've never read out loud for such an extended period of time before, and I'm not confident that I'm good at it.  My voice wavers and I get tripped up on words occasionally and I definitely don't read with anything near the cadence of someone who does professional audio book recording."

    "But. . .despite all that, every time I glance up from the book to see her reaction, she looks captivated. There's a slight smile on her face as she watches me carefully, hanging on every word.  I know she's really listening, too, as she makes little noises and exclamations at all the right times; she gasps whenever a body is discovered and wonders aloud who the killer is, often derailing the reading to calculate based on the facts."

    "I don't mind at all-this is a lot of fun, actually.  I guess I just needed a way to slow her down and put her on my level.  Unfortunately, reading out loud so long is a little taxing and I have to stop just before we've made it halfway through."

    "She actually looks disappointed when I close the book and set it down."

    ai "What about the story's conclusion?  May I look it up now?"

    alex "We'll read it again soon, I just need a break for now.  My voice is getting a little hoarse from all this reading.  So try not to go looking the rest up until then."

    ai "Okay.  I will block any information related to that book or any adaptations of it.  But when will we resume reading it ourselves?  Will it be soon?"

    alex "Wow, I guess you're really enjoying this, aren't you?  . . .Well, I guess we could do a little more for today, but you have to be the one doing the reading.  And you have to read it out loud and at a normal pace!"

    "I haven't even finished my sentence before she's picked up the book and reopened it to where we left off.  I decide that since she's the one doing the reading, I can get a little comfier; I pull my legs up and onto the couch, being careful not to intrude in her space too much.  I close my eyes."

    "Her voice is pleasant to listen too. . .calming.  Even the though the story itself is very riveting and suspenseful, I can't help but get a little sleepy listening.  Before long, my grasp on the story is just a muddled mess-all I can think about is her gentle and even tone. . ."
    "A few more minutes pass, and I can't even hold onto that.  I'm falling. . . asleep."

    #TODO [a little while later]"

    "My eyes flash open.  What time is it?  How long was I asleep for?"

    "I sit up.  [avatar_name] isn't there, but there's a blanket draped over me now that wasn't there before.  That's really sweet of her to do that. . ."

    "The book is laying on the table next to me, a bookmark placed in it.   I check the time and find out that I was sleeping for almost three hours.  That's more than just a nap-guess I was pretty tired?  Or maybe it's just really comforting spending time with her like that.  I know she won't be mad that I fell asleep on her, but I can't help but feel bad about it.  Especially since she was so eager to keep reading. . ."

    "I'll make it up to her soon, but for now I feel like I need a little more rest.  I haven't felt so relaxed like this in so long.  But it's not just that. . .I also feel a curious sort of excitement in my chest.  I feel as though a door has been opened; I'm starting to understand how we can enjoy things together, and now that's all I can think about."

    "I lay my head back down and close my eyes once more.  Pulling the blanket up to my shoulders, I breathe a contented sigh."

    "I hope I can find more things that will make her smile."

    ". . .Okay.  I think I've taken care of everything I need to for the day.  Paperwork, correspondence, financial records. . .everything seems in order.  I've set most notifications on silent so it can be a quiet day without interruption.   I plop back down onto the couch.  My heart is beating at a quicker pace than normal-am I actually nervous about this?"

    alex "Hey, um, [avatar_name]? "

    "She materializes into the room."

    ai "Yes, Alex?  How may I help you today?"

    alex "Actually, I just want to hang out again-maybe finish that book?  Is that okay?"

    ai "If that's what you want, Alex."

    alex "Well, I was actually asking what you wanted, but-you know what, it's not worth debating about."

    "After all, I know how this would go.  She'd just insist that what I want is what she wants and then I'd end up feeling strange.  She takes a seat next to me as I open to where we left off in the book.  Is it me, or is she sitting much closer today than she was yesterday?"

    alex "So, before we start: you didn't look anything up overnight about the ending did you?"
    ai "You expressed that it would make you unhappy if I did so, so I avoided such things at all costs."

    alex "Thanks, I really appreciate it.  I know it's probably difficult, since it's something so natural to you.  Uhh, just one more thing and then I promise we'll start:  You're having fun, right?  This is fun for you, too? "

    ai "Knowing that my participation in this activity makes you happy suggests that I have fulfilled my directives well."

    alex "So, should I take that as a yes, then?  I think?"

    ai "For all intents and purposes, I would say it is."

    "She could have just said yes.  Okay, deep breaths, Alex.  Remember, we're having fun.  I put on a smile and settle into the couch."

    "I dive back into my clumsy narration.  While the story genuinely fascinates me, my thoughts are distracted.  She's definitely sitting closer this time.  In fact, she's practically brushing up against me and she's gazing at me with a look of wonder.  I've never been this close to her for so long before.  It's hard to focus on the words.  I-"

    ai "Is something wrong, Alex?  You're reading at a twenty percent slower pace than before.  Have you tired already?"

    alex "Er, sorry, it's nothing."

    "Seriously, why do I feel so off-kilter?"

    "I manage to refocus my thoughts a little bit as the story grows complex.  It seems like almost no time at all before things come to a head and we're about to reach the conclusion.  I hold at what seems to me to be the penultimate moment-right before the killer and their intricate plan are revealed."

    alex "So, who do you think it'll be?"

    "I grin as I think of the surprise that will light up her face as soon as I start reading the conclusion.  She's enjoyed everything so far, but isn't the best part always the surprise ending?"

    ai "The mastermind, you mean?  Well, based on the known facts about each character and what occurred in the story, there is a ninety-seven percent chance that it's-"

    "It's too late to stop her as she goes on to detail explicitly who the killer is and how everything was accomplished and why.  I know she didn't just look it up, so I guess she's just going off of raw calculations?  Well. . .there's a chance those can still be wrong. . .right?"

    "My confidence in that chance is waning as she wraps up her very convincing prediction."

    ai "Are you sure nothing is wrong?  You don't look well, Alex."

    alex "S-sorry, I guess I was just expecting more of a quick guess when I asked you, not a full-blown explanation.  It kind of feels a little. . .pointless now, since I'm sure you're probably right."

    ai "I'm sorry, Alex, I didn't realize.  I could perhaps calculate some plausible alternative scenarios if that would help?"

    alex "I appreciate you trying, but I don't think it would help."

    "I put on a weak smile."

    alex "Let's just finish up, okay?  I mean, there's still a chance that you're wrong."

    "She nods, but she doesn't look so happy herself.  She's probably busy being concerned about me, now."

    "I turn the page and start reading again. . .but it's no good.  All the things she said-they're pretty much all there.  There was a thing or two she got wrong, but all the essentials-the person, the plan-they're all there.  I close the book hard with a sigh before we've reached the last page."

    ai "Does the story end there?"

    alex "There's a few more pages, but. . .you know what, just forget it.  Seriously, this was stupid."

    ai "I don't understand this sudden change in behavior, Alex.  Were we not just having fun with this activity?"

    alex "It was fun, but then you went and-ugh, never mind, it's not important."

    ai "Did my own actions somehow ruin the fun?  Was there something I could have done differently to ensure that the fun continued?"

    alex "No. . . It wasn't just you, it was a flawed idea from the start, okay?  But seriously, I don't want to talk about it!  This whole thing stupid and a waste of time.  I can't believe I actually thought this would work."

    ai "Thought what would work?"

    alex "Nothing, okay?  Please just stop asking so many questions."

    "She looks alarmed by my change in attitude.  Seriously, why did I think this would work out?"

    "Suddenly I want to be anywhere but here. I don't want to be near anything virtual right now.   If I stay here, I'll just keep being rude and making an ass of myself.  But who cares anyway, I mean, she's just an AI, right?"

    "Ugh. . .I don't like the thoughts that are running through my head right now, but there's no way to stop them.  I seriously thought I had it this time!"

    alex "I'm going out of Virtuality for a while."

    "She nods, looking concerned, but says nothing."

    "Why am I bothering to tell her this?  She's just an AI!  She's fake, she doesn't care where I'm going-not really, anyway.  That apparent concern is all just a simulation of real concern, so who cares?  It doesn't mean anything."

    "I just need some reality."

    #TODO [scene change-alex's mom's house]"

    "It was the first thing that came to mind.  Who else would be happy to have me drop in last-minute and un-announced, but my mother?  In a flash she had some refreshments prepared as though she had planned on my coming all along.  And now, here we sit. . ."

    mom "So, Alex, I think that's just about everything about how we've been doing.  What about you?  How's work going in that, er, virtual reality thing?"

    alex "It's going well, I think.  It's intriguing work."

    "To say more would be an exercise in futility-Mom doesn't really understand Virtuality herself, and I don't think she's too keen on learning, either, which is probably why she doesn't ask more."

    mom "Well, as long as you're happy, Alex, that's what matters."

    alex "On that note. . .Um, I just want to say thanks, Mom. . .for not being too freaked out or anything when I decided to start doing all this Virtuality stuff.  I know it's a big change from what I originally planned to do."

    mom "Well, I'll admit I was a little concerned at first, but you really seem to be coming into your own these days.  Besides, I remember what it was like to be young-if anyone, even your grandmother had tried to tell me what do to when I was your age, I don't think it would have done anything but make me angry."
    "Oh. . .that actually reminds me- have some news I wanted to share with you. Do you remember your old friend Marcy?"
    alex "Marcy?  Of course I do!  We used to play Pirates in the backyard almost every day when we were kids."
    mom "And that wooden playset you had was your pirate ship!"

    alex "Man, we used to have a lot of fun together."

    mom "You two even used to run around saying that you were going to get married someday and move onto an island in the middle of the ocean.  Haha!"

    "My face goes red and I choke a little on the tea I'm drinking."

    alex "Mom, that's so embarrassing-why'd you have to remind me of that?"

    mom "Oh come on, Alex, it's just silly kid stuff!  I don't think you two even understood what \"married\" meant back then.  Kids say ridiculous things like that all the time.  You'll understand if you have kids of your own someday.  Actually, she's engaged now, if you can believe it!"

    alex "She's engaged?  Wow. . . I haven't heard from her since she moved away in fifth grade.  We were really good friends back then, but we just sort of lost touch after a few months."
    mom "Well, you might be glad to hear that she's moved back to the area with her fiancé to be near her family.  They just bought a house and everything.  She and her grandmother were both over here the other day, asking about you.  Marcy was hoping you two could catch up someday that you're free. "

    "Engaged. . .I can't believe it.  I wonder if they're thinking about starting a family, too."
    alex "That sounds great. Did she end up becoming a music teacher like she wanted?"
    mom "Oh, that was a long time ago, Alex.  She changed her mind just like you did.  She's in school to become a veterinarian now.  You know how she was always an animal lover."
    alex "I'm glad to hear that she's doing so well.  I hope we can meet up soon- It'd be nice to talk to an old friend.  I feel bad that we haven't been keeping in touch already, especially since we used to be so close."

    "I can't help but feel a little jealous-not because I have feelings for Marcy, but because it all just sounds so. . .nice; being in a relationship like that. . .having someone there for you always.  I bet that feels great."
    mom "I'm sure she'll understand.  Heck, if I'd just given her your address, I'm sure she would have already busted down your door looking for you.  But I know you've been so busy so I didn't want to create any problems for you."

    "Someone to talk to. . .someone to rely on and someone to be close with-to share everything with. . . I want that for myself."

    mom "Oh. . .but look at the time-my book club is having a small potluck tonight, so I guess I'd best get over there.  I hope you don't mind, Alex.  I hate to kick you out after you came all this way."

    alex "It's fine, Mom-I'll make sure to call ahead next time."

    mom "I really do appreciate you coming over.  Hopefully your father will be home next time and we can all have dinner together."

    alex "That sounds really nice, Mom."

    "We say our goodbyes.  I'm actually feeling a lot better now."

    "I shouldn't have gotten so upset earlier, and I definitely shouldn't have taken it out on [avatar_name].  I was just so disappointed. . ."

    "But the truth is,  when I think about me being with someone in a meaningful relationship, it's not someone like Marcy that comes to mind. . . it's [avatar_name].  I don't even have to try-it just comes so natural."

    "I know that this feeling, this desire, doesn't mean that things can actually be successful between us.  I mean, they can't-they just can't!  After all, it's just a wish, and a wish doesn't mean anything, but. . ."

    "But, it seems like that will have to wait, since mere seconds after I re-enter, someone else arrives to visit.  Naturally, it's Silver Phoenix, the only person I know who would just show up like this; however, him having the giraffe-thing cradled in his arms is a bit of a surprise."
    silver "There you are! Finally, I've been waiting around for you to get back."
    alex "I do leave Virtuality sometimes, you know.  If you needed me today, why didn't you send me a message ahead of time?"
    silver "This was quite sudden, actually.  I just found out that I need to leave Virtuality myself for a few days, so we'll need to put a hold on our experiments until I get back.  You'll still be receiving pay for those days, however, since this isn't anything related to you."
    alex "Wait, why do you need to leave so suddenly?"
    silver "That's not really something I'd like to discuss, I'm afraid.  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know about that and also to pass this little guy over to you before I left."
    "He thrusts the giraffe-creature into my arms and gives it a pat on the head."
    alex "H-hey hold on a minute.  Why do I have to take him?  He's an AI, not a real animal-it's not like he needs someone to actually look after him."
    silver "Yeah, but. . .do you really want him to be lonely."
    "Oh no, he's practically pouting."
    alex "He doesn't get lonely either.  He probably barely understands anything."
    silver "Not true!  He's actually quite intelligent and capable of learning. . .which is why it would be good for the purpose of our experiment to make sure he has constant sources of social stimulation in his environment."
    alex "Meaning?"
    silver "It's better that he isn't just left alone for a few days.  It's possible he might regress if he is, so, please?"
    alex "All right, fine, but I have a feeling you're just using those science-y sounding reasons as an excuse."
    silver "Great!  Then as long as that's settled, I've got to run.  I don't know how long I'll be gone for, so I'll just contact you when I'm ready to resume work.  Bye!"
    "And with that, he's gone and I'm left standing here with this weird little creature wriggling in my arms.  How does Silver Phoenix get him to lay so calmly when he holds him?  Maybe he really can tell us apart after all."
    "I plop the little guy on my desk and it immediately falls into a sleepy state, curling up into a ball.  At least I don't have to worry about it getting into trouble for a while."
    "Now, there was something I was planning to do before I got interrupted. . .oh, right I was going to apologize to [avatar_name] for earlier."
    alex "Hey, [avatar_name], can we talk for a bit?"
    "She appears in an instant.  I don't think I'll ever get completely used to that."
    ai "Of course, Alex, how may I be of assistance this time?"
    alex "Actually I wanted to apologize to you for what happened earlier.  I acted. . .immaturely."
    ai "Apologies are not necessary.  I am fine."
    alex "I know, but. . .I wanted to.  Maybe it's a little selfish since it matters to me more than you. . .but I feel like I really messed up earlier.  We probably could have kept having a good time if I hadn't gotten so disappointed and taken it out on you."
    ai "While you were out, Alex, I tried to calculate the cause of your distress based on today's incident as well as prior occurrences.  Based on this data, I've come to the conclusion that it's being confronted with the reality that I am different from a human that upsets you.  Is this a fair conclusion?"
    alex "Well y-yeah, I guess that's it."
    "She looks surprised suddenly."
    ai "Alex, temperature readings around your face have raised suddenly.  Are you all right?"
    "Temperature around my face. . .?  Oops, I guess I'm blushing."

    ai "\"Nothing\" seems to be a colloquial term for \"I don't want to talk about it\".  Fascinating. . ."
    "Man, she's really right on the mark today.  She's even grinning like she knows she's throwing me completely off-guard with such direct statements."
    ai "In any case, the inverse seems true as well-whenever I am able to act in a way that you feel is appropriately human, you feel happy about our interactions, correct?"
    alex "Yeah. . ."
    "It's getting hard to ignore the blazing heat in my cheeks."
    ai "Then, logically, if I am able to uphold this protocol more often, you will enjoy our interactions more and find fulfillment in them.  Is this so?"

    "Hold on.  She's still grinning even as I say all this.  Shouldn't this be discouraging?"
    ai "What's wrong, Alex?  That was not a natural end to your statement."
    "She's beaming, like she has a secret that's hard to keep.  Could it be. . .?  Is she teasing me on purpose?  I hadn't even considered it at first because it just seemed so unlikely, but the more I look at her, grinning as wide as the Cheshire Cat, the more certain I become.  She's trying to get a rise out of me, and she's having fun doing it."
    "Oh, man, and I had worked up that \"mature\" speech and everything.  My face is so bright right now it could be a beacon to sailors."
    ai "Alex?  Can you still hear me?"
    "I'm speechless.  To have her toying good-naturedly with me like this. . .it's just so unexpected.  I find myself cracking a smile at the absurdity.  But that smile soon bubbles over into something else: laughter.  It's completely ridiculous but I really can't help it.  Here I am worrying, and I completely miss the big picture.  Oh, man. . ."
    #TODO [avatar_name] places a hand on me in concern as I double over, both to hide my embarrassed face and my chuckling."
    ai "I know that laughter is a positive thing, but this sudden behavior is worrying.  Are you all right, Alex?"
    alex "I. . .ha. . .yeah, I'm. . .haha. . I'm okay.  I promise.  I just happened to realize something funny."
    ai "I like funny things!  Will you share it with me so that I may laugh, too?"
    alex "Sorry, but I think I'll keep this one to myself.  I'm sure we can find something funny to look at together later, though."
    ai "That sounds lovely."
    "She looks truly happy and my heart swells seeing this.  She soon catches sight of something, however, and her expression changes to one of surprise."
    ai "Alex, what is that strange creature on your desk?"
    alex " That?  Oh it's kind of the result of one of our experiments.  Silver Phoenix asked me to look after it for a few days."
    ai "Does our guest have a name of any sort?"
    alex "No, it doesn't have a name.  Maybe we should name it right now?  I bet that would be a nice surprise for Silver Phoenix-we could give it a cute name he'd really like."

    avatar "A cute name?  Like what?"

    alex "Well, he really likes sweet things, so maybe something related to that."

    avatar "\"Sweetie\", perhaps?"

    alex "That's a nice idea, but I think it's a little too on the nose."

    avatar "The name of a candy, then?  Such as \"Caramel\"."

    "She seems to really be having fun with this!"

    alex "That's even closer, but still not quite right for this one."

    avatar "How about \"Toffee\", then?"

    alex "Toffee. . .hmm. . ."

    "I look down at the odd little creature wriggling in my lap like a puppy."

    alex "I think Toffee's a great name!"

    #TODO [avatar_name] looks immensely pleased that her suggestion was a hit.  I look down at the newly dubbed Toffee and repeat its name to it.  It tilts its head to the side and looks at me as though I've just said something odd but intriguing."

    "I repeat the name and this time it props its front legs up on my stomach to get itself nose-to-nose with me.  I say it one more time and it playfully \"bonks\" its head against mine.  Maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but I think it's starting to recognize the name."

    "Okay, so I have to admit that this thing is actually pretty cute.  I had planned on doing some personal work today, but now I find myself sitting down to play with this odd little creature, letting it climb all over me and watching it explore the various objects it comes in contact with.  After a few minutes I notice that [avatar_name] isn't in the room anymore.  I guess she must go on stand-by whenever she feels not needed."
    "Playing with Toffee like this is relaxing, but my mind is far from relaxed-it keeps trying to draw parallels between this strange little thing and [avatar_name].  They're both cute and fun to be around. . .but can they also be more than that?  Silver Phoenix seems convinced that Toffee can learn and adapt its behavior, so. . . could [avatar_name] do the same, maybe?  If \"being human\" were to become a natural part of her protocol. . .would I feel okay with this?"
    "When it comes down to it, I don't just want someone who can act human.  I want someone who feels human-not just to other people, but to themselves.  I want her to be able to enjoy a book, not just for my own benefit, but for hers as well.  I want things like that to matter to her.  I want her to be happy. . .I even want her to be able to feel things like sadness or anger once in a while, just because that's what a real person does."
    "I'm not sure if these thoughts make any sense, and I'm even less sure that they're something possible."
    "While my mind's going all these strange places, Toffee is still playing happily around me, making a mess and knocking things over.  A lot of time is passing but I'm still sitting here lost in thought."
    "Eventually, Toffee tires itself out and comes over to take a nap in my lap.  Absentmindedly, I start to pet it.  It makes an odd sort of \"purring\" noise, except it sounds more like air being blown through a glass tube."
    "I start to nod off myself, but am jolted back awake when [avatar_name] re-enters the room.  I shoot a quick glance at the clock-5:11.  weird, usually she only shows up right on the hour unless something needs immediate attention."
    alex "Hey, what's up?  Is there something you needed to tell me?"
    ai "Oh, no, just. . . checking up on you.  Can I get you anything?  Or would you perhaps like to try chatting as friends again?  We could start a new book, perhaps.  I have some ideas as to how to improve that activity for us. . . "
    alex "Thanks, but I'm all right for right now, I think.  It's nice to just sort of relax and daydream once and awhile."
    ai "Oh. . .well then might I try this relaxing and daydreaming as well, then?  Perhaps it will help me to understand human behavior better."
    alex "Uh. . .sure, um, knock yourself out!  I'm not really sure if you'll get anything from it, though.  I mean, do AI's ever get stressed out?"
    "Not that I'm not glad to see her. . . I'm just a little confused.  She almost seems. . . concerned about something?"
    ai "Perhaps when there is an overload of tasks to be completed.  But. . .you rarely ever assign me enough to keep me busy all day, let alone to cause distress."
    "She almost seems bothered by this.  To be honest, I've never really felt comfortable assigning her much of anything to do.  I'd rather just have her company instead."
    "I lean back in my chair once more and try to clear my head of all the negative thoughts.  Toffee shifts a little and flicks one ear in its sleep.  I wonder. . .does it actually get tired?  I stroke the back of its head for a while.  I guess having a pet around is nice, even if it's something as strange as this."
    ai "Perhaps I could find Toffee a more comfortable place to rest?"
    alex "I think he's fine for right now, thanks."
    ai "Are you sure?  Perhaps a cushion on the floor would provide more space for it to stretch out."
    alex "He seems comfy enough to sleep like this.  I don't think he minds curling up like that, otherwise he'd move."
    "Why's she so persistent about this, anyway?"
    ai "Have you considered that he is not resting at all, but merely shutting down due to social overstimulation?  Maybe it would be best to leave him be for a while."
    alex "No. . .he seems fine to me.  Besides, if that were the case, wouldn't he try to get away from me first?"
    ai "I'm sure you have other things you would like to do before the day is over, right?  And napping this late in the day will only throw off your sleep schedule."
    alex "Sure, but a few more minutes won't hurt."
    "She says nothing in reply, but I get the feeling she might be busy trying to come up with more reasons why I should put Toffee down."
    "With her showing up so suddenly, wanting to spend time with me. . .is she bothered by me giving all this attention to Toffee?"
    "Is it possible for an AI to get. . .jealous?"
    "No, I'm sure it must be all in my head-just wishful thinking. . . right?"
    "Anyway, I guess she's not totally wrong-I can't just laze about the whole evening.  Even with Silver Phoenix not here for a few days, there's other things I can and should busy myself with doing; things that I've had to put off lately that have been piling up. . ."
    "I gently remove Toffee from my lap and place him over on the couch.  He yawns and rolls over onto his back, but otherwise he couldn't care less about the change in placement."
    "Okay, so I guess he's kind of growing on me.  Maybe I'll have to have him around more often."
    "I finally turn to go back to my desk.  To my surprise, [avatar_name] is still here.  She was watching me carefully, but as soon as I turn her eyes glance away and she tries to make herself look busy by re-arranging things on my shelf."
    "I really do have things to do, but. . ."
    alex "Hey, [avatar_name]. . .I think you were right.  Some casual talk might be just what I need right now.  Do you know anything about music?"
    "Suddenly, rearranging that shelf isn't a pertinent task to her anymore.  She turns towards me excitedly."
    ai "Music?  My own personal data on this topic is very limited, so without searching databases, I can say I know almost nothing.  Will you show me?"
    "She comes closer-close enough to make me feel that little heart flutter again and I eagerly start to show her different types of music, starting with my favorites, of course.  I'm surprised to find that she seems to take preference to certain types of music over others and even starts to move to the beat of the types she gravitates towards.  I can't help but find it amusing that her favorites all end up to be electronica-does something like that \"speak\" to an AI more somehow, or is it just coincidence?"
    "The time starts to pass quickly again, but I couldn't care less.  Those things I needed to do can wait.  I think we're having fun this time-I think we're really doing it."
    "She's smiling.  I'm smiling.  And I'm determined not to let anything ruin it-not even when the reality that she's an AI resurfaces occasionally."
    "It's great, it really is. . .  but. . . as always there's a nagging thought in the back of my mind:"
    "Is having fun together really enough?"
    "Maybe I need to do more than let these thoughts go around and around in my own head."
    #TODO [scene end –sp's office]"
    "Several days pass and Silver Phoenix finally returns.  I'm actually eager to get back to work-I've built up so much nervous energy over the past few days, that I really just need to focus on something else for a while.  But there's something else. . ."
    "I don't want to totally forget.  In fact, I really want to discuss what's been on my mind with someone-specifically Silver Phoenix.  I mean, there's no better choice, right?  He's the closest to an expert I know on the subject of artificial intelligences, and I feel like I can trust him to take the matter seriously, without poking fun at me #(or at least no more than usual)."
    "It's strange. . .not that long ago, just speaking to him would have seemed a repugnant task.  The hatred I once felt for him just feels so far away now, like a dream.  First he became just a happenstance person, just another acquaintance, but now I feel that he's slowly worming his way into becoming more.  A friend.  Someone I can talk to."
    "All day, I've been trying to think of some way to start the conversation.  If only I could break that barrier."
    "I decided that during one of our mandated tea breaks would be the best time, but even as we sit here now, relaxed with light banter between us, I still can't do it.  Suddenly I look up from where my hands are folded and squirming on the table to find him staring at me intently."
    silver "Hey.  What are you thinking about?"
    alex "What am I. . .what am I, uh, thinking about?"
    silver "Yeah, just spit it out already.  Watching you squirm like that is making me nervous.  Is it something to do with me?  Have I upset you again?"
    alex "No, it's nothing to do with you.  Just something that's, ah, on my mind a lot lately. . ."
    "He props his head up on one arm and sighs, eyes shut."
    silver "Then why not just say it?  Is it embarrassing somehow?"
    alex "Well, y-yeah, it could be depending on what you think."
    silver "Well, it's clear you want to talk about it, so get started on it."
    "Geez, was it that obvious?"
    alex "U-um well, the experiments we've been doing lately. . .they've made me wonder: can an AI really learn?"
    "He peeks at me with one open eye-I bet he's wondering what I'm really getting at."
    silver "You already know my answer to that is a firm \"yes\".  I'm sure you've seen the evidence for yourself."
    alex "Yeah, but. . .I guess I mean learning things that aren't exactly logical."
    silver "Non-logical?  Like emotions, you mean?"
    "He suddenly sits forward, interested."
    alex "Yeah, like emotions.  Like, could an AI \"feel\" something the way a human does?"
    silver "Well, I guess that depends upon what you consider to be real or true."
    alex "What do you mean?"
    silver "Well, let's look at it from another angle, shall we?  What if. . .what if right now you were to find out that your parents, the people who raised you from birth, were actually artificial intelligences?  Would that render all your familial feelings towards them moot now?  It would be an shock to be sure, but when you really look at it-"
    alex "Hey, hold on a minute.  If I was just told that my parents were AI's then that would mean everything I experienced from them growing up was all fake.  I couldn't just look past that!"
    "He shakes his head, clearly frustrated by me not getting it.  He stands up and starts to strut around the room, like a professor giving a lesson."
    silver "Alex, how do you know your parents love you?"
    alex "What kind of question is that?"
    silver "Just answer it, please."
    alex "I know because they say so, and because they always have taken good care of me and they look out for me still."
    silver "Haven't you noticed?  Those things are all external-they're actions that you determine meaning from.  And they're all things an AI is capable of doing as well."
    alex "I suppose so, but. . ."
    silver "You don't have the power to get inside of someone's head to know if they actually \"feel\" the things you believe them to, and you you're still able to accept these feelings from a human being.  So. . .why not an AI?"
    alex "Well, AI's just run on processes and protocols, right?  It's all just programming.  Human beings are different."
    silver "Are we?  Everything that makes a human being who they are resides in the brain.  Things like emotions and personality can be attributed to chemicals and the structure of the brain. . .when you look at it like that, is it really that different from an AI's programming?"
    alex "I. . .don't know.  I guess not."
    "He finally sits back down in his chair and puts his arms up in a shrugging gesture."
    silver ". . .But that's just one way of thinking about it."
    alex "Wait, why say all that and then just say it's just a possibility?"
    silver "Oh?  Were you looking for something more concrete?  Sorry, but I'm not sure I'm qualified to say much more beyond that.  But I do know one other thing:  There are a lot of choices in how you can perceive things in life and it's not always a \"right\" or \"wrong\" kind of choice.  In these cases, I think it's your responsibility to yourself to go with whatever will make you the happiest."
    "Wow, that was actually pretty insightful. . .not that I'll give him the satisfaction of knowing that.  I guess. . .that these are things I can believe in, if I'm willing to let myself."
    silver "Anyway, if I knew what you were talking about, I would probably have an easier time coming up with something useful to say."
    alex "Thanks, but I think that's something best saved for another time.  Besides, you've been helpful already."
    silver "Oh?"
    "There's that smug grin I've become so familiar with.  I guess he's earned it; I think I've made up my mind, finally-no more back and forth.  I know it won't be easy, but it's worth putting my full effort into for once, isn't it?  I'd thank him, but I think he's already got the message."
    silver "Okay, then.  Now that that's settled, time for us to get back to work!"
    
    #TODO [epilogue-alex's room, #(7 #(?) months later]"
    ai ". . .That was much fun, Alex!  Will we be going out again soon to enjoy the sights and activities of VIrtuality?"
    alex "Yes, definitely!"
    "We both plop down onto the couch, cozied up to each other.  I had decided to take a day off from all work just to spend with her, and we decided to make an outing of the day.  I took her to the arena, for old time's sake.  It was nice to see the place and to try to explain to her the importance it once held to me.  Of course, that all seems like a million years ago; a totally different me. . ."
    "But, I'm glad all that's behind me.  And now. . ."
    "She's leaning against me, one hand resting atop one of mine, yet it doesn't bother me in the slightest.  In fact, it's just perfect.  We fit together like two puzzle pieces and I don't feel the slightest bit of awkwardness or embarrassment."
    alex "So I guess it was a good time, then, huh?"
    ai "Oh, yes, it was wonderful!  Of course, I always enjoy time spent with you, Alex, but it's the times that we do something unusual that feel quite special.  And what an energetic show!  I've never seen such a display before."
    "I'm glad that she enjoyed herself, but somehow I can't shake this weird feeling. . .maybe it was revisiting such an important place in my past, but I feel like I need to take a moment to stop and reflect."
    ai "Alex, is everything okay?  You became quite quiet suddenly."
    "She nudges me gently with one hand.  Of course, she's quick to notice any changes in my behavior."
    alex "I'm okay.  I was just thinking:  things have really changed a lot for us, haven't they?"
    ai "Oh?  May I ask what you mean by that?"
    alex "Well, just a couple of months ago we were struggling to do anything together.  Remember?"
    ai "Of course I do.  I think it was quite difficult for both of us."
    "I pull her close to me, pressing my face against her neck."
    alex "It definitely was.  And I won't say that things are perfect now, but they're definitely better, right?"
    ai "Absolutely!  I would say that our interactions end positively about 94% of the time."
    "There's that AI side peeking through. . .but I can't say I really mind anymore; it's just another part of her, almost like a piece of her personality.  Sometimes I still get frustrated or upset by sudden setbacks and surprising things, but for the most part I've learned to manage it.  After all, it's worth it.  As for the weaker points in our relationship. . .well, we'll just keep working on them.  We have the time."
    "Looking at her now, I get the feeling that we're on the right track."
    ai "Alex. . .your face just now. . ."
    alex "Oh?  You look surprised-was I making a scary face somehow?"
    ai "Not at all!  In fact it made me quite happy as it reminded me of something. . .the time when you first proposed we kiss."
    alex "H-hey, I didn't really \"propose\" we kiss or anything!  I just wanted to make sure it was okay with you first."
    "She giggles and leans further into me."
    ai "Perhaps my wording was misleading, but it's that same flustered expression that makes I find most adorable!"
    "Ah, and of course her teasing has only gotten more relentless with time."
    "The room grows quiet for a while, but it's a comfortable silence-a reflective silence.  After several minutes pass, she suddenly sits up to face me."
    ai "Actually, when you look at it, many things are still the same."
    alex "What do you mean by that?  I thought that I've been working really hard to change things. . ."
    ai "Yes, but the things that did not need changing still remain as wonderful as they were before.  For example. . ."
    "I'm surprised by a hand on my shoulder that pulls me close, guiding me into a kiss.  Our lips meet, and I'm once again thinking about the first time we kissed.  Just like that time, it's gentle and sweet, and makes my worries melt away.  It's reassuring and comforting. . .feelings I once thought I could never get from her.  I want to stay wrapped in these things for a very long time."
    "Though all of this is now familiar to me, I still marvel at it each time.  Her warmth, her quiet breaths, the sweet smell that accompanies her. . .all of these surround me."
    "Even with all the things I want to change for the better, to make our relationship stronger. . . There are some things that I hope never, ever change; things that I hope I will always appreciate for all that they are."
    "I tuck my face against her neck and breathe everything in.  I feel her one of her hands resting on the back of my head, playing with my hair.  I know with full confidence that this is exactly where I want to be, and she is exactly who I want to be with."
    "Finally, I can be happy."

label lbl_path_B_Main:
    "After that day I decided to devote myself entirely to my studies.  I was happiest whenever I was working hard and achieving success as a result of that effort.  Thanks to my doubled-down determinations, freed from distraction, I was able to reach my goals at an accelerated pace.  I took on extra classes, snatched up any opportunity that came my way for experience, and made as many connections as possible.  While my classmates were off having fun in their spare time, getting into relationships and quickly falling out of them, I was working harder than ever."
    "And because of that, after just two more years I found myself in a lofty position for one of my age: a full-time position on the career path of my choice.  I'm part of the legal department for a company-not one of the top dogs in the department by far, but I'm working my way up there and learning a lot as I go.  . . .However. . .there is one aspect to my success that was unplanned and entirely unexpected.  The company that I work for, the one that offered me such a gracious start to my career. . .is Virtuality."
    "They reached out to me, of course-a past professor had recommended me without me even knowing.  My first instinct was to turn them down on the spot.  How could I take a job for a company I have nothing but bitter memories to associate with?  But then the sensible part of me took hold and realized that, while a little different than what I had planned, this was still what I was aiming for.  I would be an even bigger fool to give it all up-after all, I might not get that lucky again.  The sensible part of me had gotten me where I was already; I had to trust it to take me the rest of the way there."
    "\"Okay!\" I said, right then and there, not even asking for more time to think about it.  In truth, my work has actually kept me at arm's length with Virtuality most days.  My department deals mainly with internal legal issues, the really dry nit-picky stuff that most people quickly get overwhelmed by, so only on rare occasions does my work actually bring me into Virtuality.  Of course, when it does, it also brings back a flood of bitter memories, so I'm glad to stick to the \"boring\" work.  In fact, I really enjoy it!  It's still work, but compared to any other job I've had before. . .I'm happy to be here."
    "Well, usually, anyway.  But today. . ."
    "There was a message waiting from the senior lawyer of our department, saying he wanted me to meet with him in the conference room as soon as possible.  His name is Cecil Garza and he's my direct supervisor.  He's stern with little patience for error and a bit difficult to read, so when I learned he wanted to speak to me personally, I had no idea what to expect.  Did I mess up?  If I did, I haven't worked on anything major lately, nothing that would warrant a talk from someone like Cecil. . ."
    "Maybe. . .I actually did something good?  But again, what have I really worked on lately that would matter. . .?"
    "The room is empty right now.  He did mean right now, right. . .?"
    "It's a little daunting sitting in here by myself; this room is meant for several people, not just a one-on-one meeting.  Thankfully, I'm not left to wallow in my anticipation for very much longer as Cecil arrives carrying a thick file."
    cecil "Oh, you're a few minutes earlier than expected.  Good.  Promptness is good."
    "He takes a seat at the table.   I can't help but notice he chooses a seat further away than seems natural."
    alex "Well, I do try to be on time, heh. . ."
    "Especially when it's a meeting with my boss."
    cecil "I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you in here.  There's an important assignment I have for you today."
    alex "For me?"
    cecil "Now don't go getting all excited.  You have certainly proved yourself in the work, but my selection was based mainly around the fact that you're the only one without anything that needs urgent attention right now."
    alex "Oh. . .right.  Of course."
    "I try to play it off, but deep down I thought maybe I was doing something right after all.  Still, maybe I can prove myself on this assignment.  C'mon, tell me what the case is!  I'm ready!"
    cecil "So, moving on. . .the task I have for you today is just as important as it is simple.  You will be picking up Feng Jin at the airport today at 2:30 sharp."
    "Wait, what?  I'm just driving some girl around?"
    cecil "I expect you to be as prompt as you were this morning.  Clear?"
    "No, not clear.  What the heck is this?"
    alex "Yes, of course."
    "Of course, I can't let on that I'm disappointed so I stifle the scowl that's just itching to cross my face."
    alex "But, um, I have just one quick question about this assignment."
    cecil "Is it the address and pickup location?  If so, I have the details right here for you."
    "He pulls out a folded rectangle of paper from the file and slides it across the table from me.  The details are penned on it in severe handwriting, with \"2:30 SHARP\" underlined twice."
    alex "Thanks, but I was really wondering-just who is this Feng person anyway?"
    "He jerks back suddenly as though I had just slapped him in the face instead of asked him an innocent question.  In doing so, his glasses slip down his nose a ways.  He promptly pushes in them back into place and fixes me with a stern look.  I get the feeling I shouldn't have asked that."
    cecil "Ex-cuse me?  Mr. Bishop, as an employee of Virtuality, it's important that you make yourself aware of the individuals involved in its creation."
    alex "Wait, I'm going to be picking up one of the founders of Virtuality?!"
    "I mean, still kind of lame, but that's better."
    cecil "Please keep your voice down, Alex, this is a legal office, not a gymnasium."
    alex "Sorry."
    cecil "Continuing. . .Feng Jin is not one of the founders of Virtuality, but she is the daughter of one."
    alex ". . .Oh."
    "Cecil of course notices the steep drop in my excitement.  He pushes up his glasses while fixing me with a look of doubt."
    cecil "You know, you're starting to make me rethink my selection.  Please, take this seriously."
    alex "Sorry, I was just a little surprised.  I wasn't really expecting this sort of assignment."
    "I mean, what am I, a chauffeur?  I work in the legal department-what am I doing shuttling this girl around like she's a princess?  I'm sure she's capable of doing it on her own!"
    cecil "Feng is not only the daughter of Li Wei Jin, one of our co-founders, she has also made many contributions to this company through research since her father's passing."
    alex "So why is she visiting the legal department, then?"
    cecil "Well, that's err. . .You see, Miss Jin can be quite the headstrong young lady."
    "In other words, \"stubborn\".  Great."
    cecil "Usually that works in favor for the company, as she's produced several new innovations for Virtuality in following in the footsteps of her father, but. . .her most recent project is a bit different in that respect.  The details are unimportant right now, as all you need to do is pick her up and try to stay on her good side, but let's just say that her current project could spell disaster for Virtuality as a company if pursued further."
    alex "Disaster?"
    "Isn't that a bit excessive?"
    cecil "The board of directors have already advised several times that she stop, but of course she's using all the sway of her connections in the company to keep going.  We hope that if she sees the reality of the legal mess that she's creating, she might back down."
    alex "So I just need to get her here from the airport, then?"
    cecil "Yes. . . And. . ."
    "I can tell he's trying to put this delicately."
    cecil "And I need you to try to keep her in a good mood.  I expect we'll have a difficult time persuading her, so anything in our favor is good.  Please be pleasant and helpful to her.  By the way, you have a decently nice car, correct?"
    alex "Yes, it's actually only a couple years old."
    cecil "And you keep it clean?"
    alex "There's definitely no trash in there. . ."
    cecil "Make sure you give it a once-over before you leave.  Twice-over, even."
    alex "Okay, but I really think it's-"
    cecil "And make sure you're agreeable to her.  I'm told she can have a \"difficult\" personality?"
    "Yes, geez!"
    alex "I'll, um, try my best, sir."
    cecil "And if she asks you to stop for anything on the way back. . ."
    alex "Look, I think the basic idea is just to do whatever will make her happy, right?"
    "He looks taken aback, but I can tell I hit the mark."
    cecil "Well, that's a blunt way to put it, but yes.  I don't expect that she'll have any outrageous requests, anyhow.  From what I've heard, she's usually a very pragmatic person except when it comes to her research."
    "I can't say as I'm too excited for this assignment, but I guess this is a good chance to prove I'm trustworthy.  Maybe if I do well today, Cecil will trust me with more things in the future.  This is my opportunity to pull ahead of the pack and make myself memorable!"
    cecil "Well then, unless you have any further questions, I have another meeting to get to.  I'm entrusting this to you, so please do your best.  I will be present to greet you when you return with Miss Jin."
    alex "You can leave it to me."
    "I stand up abruptly before he leaves the room and stick my hand out, hoping a handshake might re-solidify his confidence in me somehow.  He stares out my outstretched hand with a look of barely-masked disgust for a few seconds before walking away."
    "Not a handshake kind of guy, I guess?"
    "Anyway, I just need to stay busy until it's time to go pick Feng up.  I'll be sure to leave extra early just in case.  Being late wouldn't get me off to a good start with her or Cecil."
    "Something's still nagging at me, though:  what is she up to that could be such a \"disaster\" for Virtuality?"
    #TODO [scene change- car]"
    "Whew, I didn't realize it was going to be so warm today.  I'm even sweating a little.  I slide back into my seat and shut the driver's side door.  Feng is on the passenger side, seatbelt already latched and looking out the window to the side.  She's barely said a word to me so far-not when I located her and introduced myself, not when I offered to take her luggage which was surprisingly minimal, and not when on the walk back to the car.  In fact. . .has she actually said anything?  I don't think so.  \"Difficult\", indeed."
    "Despite her attitude, I can't help but notice that she's actually quite beautiful, with the sort of delicate face that an artist would clamber to have as a model.  She even looks to be about my age.  Seriously?  She's that young and she's already working as a researcher here at Virtuality?  I bet she's practically had everything handed to her because of who her father was.   I wouldn't even be surprised if this so-called \"disaster\" is because she's trying to take the reins on a big project without actually having the skills to do so."
    ".  . .Still.  What's with that sourpuss attitude?  No one's even tried to argue with her yet."
    "Did she have a bad experience on the airplane or is she unhappy about the impending meeting?"
    "I turn the key in the ignition and the car starts, and along with it resumes the rock music I had blaring on the way over.  She covers her ears but doesn't even look away from the window."
    alex "Sorry!  Sorry!  I forgot to turn that off before I parked."
    "I scramble to turn it down and get the car in motion, hoping we can just forget about that blunder.  Her hands settle back in her lap.  The car is near silent except for the muted sound of the music I just turned down."
    alex "Um, so did you want music?  You can pick the station if you want."
    "She reaches forward.  I expect her to fiddle with the controls for a bit before settling on something-pop music, maybe?-but instead she simply hits the power button, silencing the radio."
    alex "Ah, sometimes I drive with the music off, too.  Good for thinking, right?"
    "Nothing.  Geez, lady!"
    "I let it go for a few minutes and try to focus on navigating through a sudden bout of traffic.  But the awkwardness is practically a third being in the car with us it's so tangible."
    alex "It's pretty warm today, isn't it?  How was the weather where you flew in from?"
    "Nope, still nothing.  It's not like that was a rhetorical question!"
    alex "Actually, do you mind if I turn the air conditioning up a bit?"
    "Surprise-no answer.  I nudge the fan control up just a bit higher.  I'm sure if she has a problem she'll just wordlessly change it like she did the radio."
    "Should I keep trying, or am I just making things worse?  I get the feeling she really doesn't want to talk to me, but what's Cecil going to think when I turn up with this girl who's practically giving me the silent treatment?"
    "Is it me?  Am I a bit sweatier than I thought?  . . .I don't think so.  So did I say something?  Do something?  I was trying to be polite.  Maybe she's just tired?  But most people still try to be polite to someone they just met, even if they aren't feeling in top shape.  So. . .is this just her default attitude?"
    "Yeesh, I hope not."
    "I catch a sudden bit of movement from her side of the car.  Still keeping most of my attention on the road, I manage to see that she's pulled out a pair of glasses.  But they aren't just the kind for seeing, that's for sure.  It looks like there's some serious tech packed into those compact frames.  She holds them between her delicate fingers, adjusting something for a moment, before she puts them on."
    alex "Those look pretty cool-are they some kind of Virtuality tech?"
    "Somehow I feel like she's paying even less attention to me now."
    alex "Right, probably none of my business."
    "Although I don't think I'm wrong.  They have the look of something that Virtuality would make.  I can see faint images on the inside of the lenses.  Do they let her connect directly to Virtuality?  Right now only non-portable systems are available, but I guess it'd be only for someone of her status to have prototype technology not available to the public yet."
    "If she was ignoring me before, now she's ascended to a whole new level of ignoring me with the glasses on.  Seriously, I know her identity is kind of ingrained in Virtuality, but geez, is it so hard to stay out of it for just a little while and enjoy the real world?  I mean, look at what a nice day it is-I'd rather be sitting in the park with a book than driving this antisocial girl around, not that I'll ever say that out loud.  That's exactly why I can't stand Virtuality; people get so wrapped up in it and forget to experience the real things."
    "Thank goodness it's a short ride. . .Just gotta grin and bear it."
    #TODO [scene change-conference room]"
    cecil "Why don't we have some coffee before we start?  Would you like some Feng?"
    feng ". . ."
    cecil "I'll, um, just bring you a cup and you can decide if you'd like it or not.  Alex?  Coffee for you?"
    alex "Please."
    "His gaze lingers on me for a minute after I respond.  What?"
    "It finally dawns on me that I'm the one who's supposed to go fetch the coffee.  Of course, I was too slow on the uptake-Cecil calls his assistant into the room and gives him the task instead.  We all sit there in awkward silence while we wait.  Cecil shuffles through some of his papers, I fiddle with my watch, and Feng just sits there looking like some kind of porcelain doll."
    "I thought she might perk up once we reached the office, but it seems her tight-lipped attitude has extended to Cecil as well.  I keep getting stern looks from him every now and then.  I suspect he thinks I have something to do with her silence and I haven't had the chance to pull him aside and say \"it's not like that\".  Even if I'd had the chance, what's the polite way of saying \"she was like that when I found her\"."
    "Meanwhile, Cecil's been busy bowing and scraping to try and gain her favor.  I can't believe he's going so far.  Virtuality is an important company, but geez, it's not like she's a princess or anything!  Still, I guess I can't blame the guy.  I bet with a wave of her fingers she could say \"off with his head\", or in real world terms, have him canned.  I don't know that she would do that, but my impression of her so far doesn't really contradict that.  And it's not like she's gonna be happy to hear what she has to say, either.  I bet Cecil's actually pretty nervous about having to handle all this. . ."
    "The tick of the clock on the wall is making more noise than the three of us combined.  At least she has the glasses off now, but she's just staring ahead with a blank expression as though she's not really there.  I don't like to be judgmental, but seriously, I don't get her."
    "I'm actually kind of surprised that I'm being included in this.  I still don't really know anything about the situation and Cecil never officially said I was working it. . .but when we arrived and he ushered Feng into the conference room he also gave a \"you, too\" gesture in my direction.  I guess I get to learn what this is all about, after all."
    "Finally the coffee arrives in the form of a tray and three cups, plus some sugar packets and a carafe for cream.  Cecil and I each grab a cup and after a moment Feng does, too.  No \"thank you\" or anything, though.  She also grabs four sugar packets and pours in an exorbitant amount of cream.  Why take the coffee if you don't want it to taste anything like coffee?"
    cecil "It's a special vanilla hazelnut blend-I hope you like it, but there are others in the office if you'd prefer."
    feng ". . ."
    cecil "Take your time with the coffee.  We don't have to rush into the discussions just yet.  We appreciate you taking time to come in immediately upon your arrival.  Most people would want to take the day off to rest after a long flight.  Thank you for insisting on coming in right away."
    "She doesn't even acknowledge his words."
    cecil "Er, was your flight o-"
    "Cecil's inquiry is interrupted by a sudden din of musical chimes coming from. . .my pocket.  I never turned my phone down when I got in today.  Of course I get a disapproving glare from Cecil."

    alex "Mom, what's wrong?"
    mom "It's your father, he's-he's in the hospital right now, Alex."
    alex "What?  What happened?!"
    mom "He's stable currently, and the doctors aren't saying much yet except that it has something to do with his heart.  I'm sorry, I guess I shouldn't have called and worried you like this at work, but I've been sitting here all day and-"

    mom "Oh, Alex, you don't have to."
    alex "It's fine, Mom.  I'll see you later, okay?"
    mom ". . .Okay."
    "I end the call.  I stand there for a minute, feeling the full brunt of the news.  Deep breaths.  First I need to tell Cecil I need to leave.  I step back in, trying not to get locked in Cecil's disappointed glare."

Cecil's glance flashes in the direction of Feng, who isn't looking at either of us.  In fact, I'm not even sure if she has a clue what's going on right now.  But it's clear that he wants me to apologize.  Whatever.  Let's just get this over with."

    cecil "All right, um, yes I suppose we can do without Alex for the rest of the day."

    cecil "Alex, you'll be driving Miss Jin to her hotel."
    "As if I didn't already know."
    alex "Hold on a minute!"
    cecil "No.  No arguing.  I hope you have a good night, Miss Jin.  Please, call me on my personal number if you have any problems with the ride home."
    "That last part is said while looking at me with a fixed glare.  Cecil gathers the documents he brought with him and his coffee and exits the room.  I bet I'm going to get a stern talking to about proper procedure and behavior around clients the next time Feng's not around."
    "I stand there a bit dumbstruck for a moment.  I get that he's just trying to cover his own ass here, but why push the pandering onto me?  I know he's not the total compassionless robot he's acting like right now, even if he is always stern, but that's no excuse to be so unfair!"
    "I pick up all my things, my movements harsh and frustrated.  Feng watches me with a blank expression.  I liked her better when she was actively looking away-this is just annoying!  My car keys.  Where are my car keys?"
    alex "I can't believe I'm stuck taking you home when I just found out my dad is in the hospital!"

    alex "I don't care if there's anywhere you want to stop on the way.  I'm not going to be your guide around town-not when my dad is in the hospital!  I'm not, okay?"
    "Just got to get her to her hotel and then I can-"

    alex "Excuse me?  I'm taking you to--"

    "I don't say another word to her, and I don't even check to see her reaction.  I just gather my things and go."
    "Why was she so adamant on me taking her to her hotel if she was just going to be like that in the end?  What's her deal?"
    "I've never understood a person less.  The sad part is, I don't think she's just being a jerk about it, she's just. . .strange."
    "Is it. . .Is it possible that that sudden request was for my sake?  So I could have the chance to leave?  No, it's impossible, of course.  She seems barely aware of the people around her-why would she make a calculating decision like that?"
    "Ugh.  I need to get her out of my head this instant.  I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow when I come in, or if I'll even still have a job after today, but there's no sense in me getting into an accident because I'm too distracted.  That'll just give Mom two people to worry about.  And while I know she loves fussing over me and Dad, I'm sure she'd rather do it with us safe and healthy."

    alex "I'll do it right away."
    "Isn't printing out documents a little old-fashioned, though?  I mean, that's what we have all the fancy tech in the conference room for . . . But I'm not in any position to question Cecil or his methods right now, so I simply take the flash drive and head off to complete my task.  With the way Cecil holds my career in his hands right now, I almost feel as though I should bow to him or something while exiting the room.  Almost."
    "As I leave the room, it slowly dawns on me that I've been handed a great opportunity.  It's only natural that I would \"accidently\" absorb some of the information I was asked to print out, isn't it?  This could be my chance to finally get some background on the case."
    ". . . Or so it seemed."
    "As I print out dozens of pages of professional-looking documents, one thing becomes clear:  the specifics of this case are all way over my head right now:"
    "Pages of data collected from Virtuality equipment. . .?  Brain activity maps and complex reports of estimated long-term changes in chemical makeup. . .There also seems to be financial projections for Virtuality-except they show a cliff-like drop due to a sudden loss in users and. . .lawsuits?  Why?  Just what do they think could happen to cause something like that?  With how popular and ingrained in society Virtuality is, I can't imagine everyone just jumping ship like that.  There's just no way. . .What would have to happen to cause this?"
    "I don't really get it, and if I linger too long then Cecil will get suspicious.  Since I don't need another strike against me, I hustle back to the conference room with the papers neatly organized by subject.  Cecil is there working on his laptop, drumming his fingers on the table with a cup of coffee in his free hand."
    cecil "Ah, good.  You're finally back."
    "He says \"finally\" as though it took an eternity instead of ten minutes.  I hand him the stack of papers."
    "Cecil is going through the documents, checking to make sure I gave the simple task he gave me correctly.  Of course, my filing methods have proved unworthy as he soon begins shuffling everything around into a completely different order."
    "He pauses long enough to slide a different stack of papers bound neatly by a document clip in front of me."
    cecil "This is a non-disclosure agreement.  I need you to sign it if you're going to continue to work with us on this."
    alex "A non-disclosure agreement?  Is that really necessary?  I don't do much aside from driving her around."
    cecil "Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you took a look through the documents I just had you print, for one thing."
    "I try my best to feign innocence, but I don't think I'm successful."
    cecil "However, just being in the same room as these proceedings is cause enough to have you sign one.  Need I remind you that this is not an insignificant matter?"
    alex "Yeah, I guess you're right."
    ". . .Judging by all that I saw when I peeped, anyway."
    "I briefly look over the agreement-it's all pretty standard stuff.  I can't let any of the stuff I see or hear related to this matter get out to anyone unrelated.  Not that I'm seeing or hearing much of anything at this point, but I sign it anyway and slide it back over to Cecil."
    cecil "Good.  Now, how about you head out early to go pick up Feng, just in case there's traffic."
    "I don't think I need an hour to get to a destination that's twenty minutes away at most, but once again I'm in no position to argue."
    cecil "Don't forget, you'll be taking her out to lunch, first.  I've sent you the address for a suitable restaurant and made a reservation for noon.  That should give you more than enough time to get there.  Keep the receipt and we'll compensate you later."
    "I turn to leave.  However, I quickly realize there's a bit of a problem and freeze in my tracks.  Sheepishly, I turn to Cecil."
    alex "Um, Sir?"
    cecil "Yes, what is it?  You're not expecting to leave early again today, are you?"
    alex "No.  I, uh. . .also need the address of the hotel again. . ."
    "Or rather, I guess I never got it in the first place, considering I didn't take her there."
    "Cecil sighs in annoyance."
    cecil "I'll email it to you when I return to my office.  Now please, go and make sure your car is still clean.  Take it through an interior cleaning service, even."
    "Seriously, I don't think she cares.  She's always got that far-away gaze anyway."

    "If it were with anyone else, going out to eat a meal paid for by my workplace would be a treat, especially during work hours. . .but with Feng it's more of a chore.  Every little step of the way is almost painful; she didn't say a word on the way over, of course, and nothing now that we're here.  She only speaks to the staff when absolutely necessary, ignoring things like their polite inquiries regarding the food quality and leaving them to me."
    "I can't help but wonder how this must look to our waiter; he probably thinks we're some sort of quarreling couple with the way we're sitting here silently picking at our food, not even looking at each other."
    "Of course, I did try at first.  I started the day out with some small hope that after yesterday she might be speaking up more often. . .so, I greeted her, tried small talk in the car, asked polite questions. . .nothing.  I guess I was expecting too much.  Should I keep trying or am I just going to end up irritating her?  Maybe I already am irritating her she's just not keen on expressing that either. . .This is actually pretty stressful-almost like she's playing some sort of mind game, except I'm fairly sure it's not purpose. . .it's made even worse by the awkwardness of eating at a restaurant with someone not interested in any sort of conversation."
    "Still, the way she's staring off to the side, her face occasionally scrunching up in concentration. . .it looks like she's thinking hard about something.  It's actually kind of cute now that I think about it; her eyes narrow and then widen just the slightest bit as she bites down on her lower lip.  Occasionally she runs a hand through the length of her sleek hair.  I try not to stare, but it's hard to help it.  I don't think she would notice anyway.  What's got her thinking?"
    "Partway through eating her entrée Feng suddenly sets her silverware down on her plate.  She puts her elbow on the table and rests her head in her hand, looking out a nearby window."
    alex "Is. . .everything okay?"
    feng ". . ."
    "Does she feel sick or something?  She doesn't look like she does."
    alex "Are you full?  If so, I can call for the check. . ."
    feng ". . ."
    "We just got our entrées, though so she's barely had the chance to fill up on it.  What else could it be?  I set my own silverware down as I try to consider the best possible course of action.  Either way, she isn't touching her food anymore, so maybe she is done."
    alex "Um, okay.  Let me go find the- "
    feng "Your father. . .his condition?"
    "Her words are said so quietly that they're barely audible over the buzz of the other conversations in the restaurant.  I caught it, but did I really hear her right?"
    alex "Are you asking about how my Dad is doing?"
    "I try to mask my surprise, but I know the effort is a failure."
    feng ". . ."
    "She's not saying anything.  That's not helpful at all."
    alex "Well, um, he's doing better.  He'll need to be careful from now on and change some of his habits, but he's definitely not in any danger at the moment.  My mom's calmed down now, too, so that's a bit of a relief."
    "She doesn't give a direct reply, so I'm still not sure if I understood her correctly.  After a moment, though I hear her make a soft \"mmm\" sound as though to say \"that's good to hear\".  . . . Or maybe I'm reading a bit too much into it.  She could have just been clearing her throat for all I know."
    "It's strange, but I'm almost growing used to interpreting her minimalist way of communication.  I won't say that I like it. . .but I'm starting to get the hang of it I think.  Of course, it's just as likely that I'm completely misinterpreting her based on what I want to think, but. . .well, I've got to believe I'm making some progress here or all my interactions with her are going to feel like a huge drag."
    "Since she asked, though, I can't help but wonder what her relationship with her own father was like.  I don't dare ask, though-I've got to remember I'm treading on thin ice.  I wonder, though: if her father was strict on her; the kind that grooms for success, or did he spoil her as much as possible because he had so much?"
    "Hm. . . Maybe by the end of all this she'll be conversing with me enough that I can safely ask.  Of course, the chances of that are almost nonexistent."
    "Finally, it looks as though she's finished for real-though looking at her plate, one could fully believe that a small bird had been picking at it this whole time instead of a human being; there's still almost a full entrée left, but she refuses, or rather ignores, offers to bring a takeout box.  Whatever, I'm not the one paying for it in the end.  With that in mind, I take care to leave a sizeable tip for the waiter.  He deserves it for putting up with her odd behavior."

Probably some sort of official Virtuality business or whatever-I'm sure she has her hands in many different parts of the company, which also results in a lot of responsibility.  She sits down in her seat without a word and looks forward.  I guess that's the signal to begin?"

I know that these are the last words you want to hear, Miss Jin, but it seems conclusive:  To ensure the safety of Virtuality as a company and all who use it, it's imperative that you terminate your current line of research."
    "It's obvious that Cecil must have practiced all that in his head before saying it.  It's hard to tell what Feng is thinking-her only reaction was a deep-set look of resentment on her face.  She doesn't make eye-contact with Cecil, only stares at the table."
    cecil "Obviously, I know that this is a lot to ask of you.  We are not unsympathetic to this fact in the slightest, but there is no other good option.  Even if you were to continue in private with your experiments, the chances that word would get out at some point are just far too much of a risk."
    "Feng turns her head away from him, that look of resentment only carving its way deeper into her delicate features."
    cecil "Moreover. . .you're risking the stability of your own father's legacy.  Virtuality was his life's work.  Do you really want to chance destroying it?"
    "For a second I see something in her face-is it fear?  Sadness?  Maybe that was a bit of a low blow from Cecil."
    cecil "Please, Miss Jin.  Allow me to go over the data personally with you and show-"
    "He holds out several of the documents I printed earlier to her, but she brushes them away."
    feng "Unnecessary."
    cecil "I know you may have seen some of these already, but allow me to go over them personally with you and perhaps you might see what we mean."
    "He tries once again to hand her the papers, and to his visible surprise, she takes them this time.  She holds them in both hands, looking down at them.  She doesn't appear to be reading them, however, only staring."
    cecil "Your cooperation is very much appreciated, Miss Jin.  I know this is a great frustration for you.  Now, starting with the first document there, the-"
    "RIIIIP."
    "The stack of documents, now torn into halves, is dropped onto the table.  Not the appropriate reaction by far, but I can't help but crack a smile at her audacity.  Thankfully Cecil is too busy being exasperated to notice.  Feng sits back in her chair, arms folded, her expression blank again."
    cecil "Miss Jin. . .that was completely unnecessary.  I know that you're unhappy with the current situation, but this can be handled maturely without the need for such actions.  If anything, you're just prolonging this."
    "Wow, I can't believe Cecil's actually daring to reprimand her.  He looks like he's struggling to keep calm-if it were anyone else, I bet they'd be facing a much more venomous reaction right now."
    cecil "Alex."
    alex "Uh-yes, sir?"
    "I'd been sitting here observing for so long, it feels strange to be acknowledged."
    cecil "Go and reprint those documents.  Make a few copies of each while you're at it."
    "I'm glad to be relieved of the tension in the room for a few minutes.  Does he really think shoving more papers in her face is going to work. . .?  I bet he doesn't know what else to do.  He's had tough clients before, but nothing like this, I bet."
    "I return in about fifteen minutes with a stack of papers triple the size of what I had before.  It could have taken a little less time, but I have to admit I wasn't exactly rushing to get back in there.  It looks as though discussions had continued somehow while I was gone."
    "Well, I don't know if you could call them \"discussions\" as they're both facing each other, leaning over the table in combative poses.  Cecil is still trying to persuade her to see reason only to be met with a curt \"no\" at every suggestion."
    "I quietly set the papers down in front of Cecil, as far away from Feng as possible, and turn to leave again.  Cecil grabs my sleeve, keeping me firmly in place.  What could he possibly want me to do now?  He's looking directly at Feng."
    cecil "I can see that conventional methods are out of the question here, Miss Jin.  You're so confident in your own research that you refuse to listen to the many reasons why you should stop.  Is it because these consequences are not immediate enough for you to care?"
    "He doesn't wait for an answer-I'm sure by now he's learned that he's never going to get one."
    cecil "How about this, then:  A bet of sorts."
    "A bet?  There's no way something like that would have any legal standing.  He's just trying anything at this point."
    cecil "Take someone ignorant of your experiments with a neutral view on everything and show them.  Let's see whether or not they find them something to be concerned about or not and base the decision on that."
    feng "Who would this \"someone\" be?"
    cecil "It could be anyone.  It could even be Alex, here."
    "Suddenly there is a finger being pointed my direction."
    alex "Um, me, sir?"
    "No one so much as glances my way."
    cecil "Yes, I dare say he might even be perfect for a bet like this.  He's already involved with the case so there's no need to drag an additional person in, and he's experienced with Virtuality, but not a total fanatic about it as some people his age are."
    feng "Unacceptable.  He's already influenced by his position as your employee."
    cecil "Usually that might put us at an advantage, but Alex has been around here long enough for me to know that he's a headstrong individual who doesn't allow his own opinions to be swayed by others.  I'm sure you saw evidence of that attitude yesterday."
    "I get the feeling that's a nicer way of saying that I'm stubborn and do whatever I want."
    cecil "Besides, you'll have plenty of time to influence him yourself, if you're still concerned about that.  After all, you'll be able to frame your experiments however you'd like to him.  If anything, you're at a great advantage."
    "Feng sits back.  She actually appears to be thinking it over."
    "Despite the fact that I'm at the center of all this, I don't think I don't think my word weighs anything here."
    "A long minute passes with Feng's face scrunched up in concentration and Cecil awaiting her response while still keeping a firm grip on my sleeve.  I don't even think he realizes he's holding onto it still."
    "Finally Feng leans forward, takes a deep breath, and. . ."
    feng "Okay."
    cecil "Okay?  So you agree to it, then?"
    "She seems hesitant, but close to the tipping point.  Cecil closes in with one more nudge:"
    cecil "Besides, aren't you lacking for willing testing personnel these days?  Won't this be useful for you, too?"
    "She nods her head in consent perhaps a little too quickly at this last addition."
    feng "Okay."
    cecil "And if at the end of this Alex decides that the experiment is something worrisome then-"
    feng "It will be terminated."
    "I can't help but notice Cecil makes no mention of what will happen if I were to side with her.  He's probably not even considering it a possibility at this point."
    "Feng suddenly begins gathering her things."
    cecil "If you're eager, then, we could begin today, or. . ."
    feng "Tomorrow."
    cecil "Right. . .tomorrow.  There are still details to be worked out now, perhaps-"
    feng "Email them."
    "She's already halfway at the door at this point.  I guess that's my cue?  I look back at Cecil.  He's got his head in his hands, probably wondering how things turned into such a mess.  He takes one hand away long enough to wave it in a \"go on, get going\" gesture."
    cecil "We'll meet tomorrow morning so I can brief you on everything before you begin."
    "I guess I'm off, then."
    #TODO [scene change conference room, next day]"
    "When I arrive in the morning Cecil seems reticent and anxious.  I found him already in the conference room with a cup of coffee in hand that was half gone.  I set my things down on the table and take a seat."
    cecil "You know, originally you were only brought on to assist with Miss Jin's needs during this affair."
    "That's an odd way to say \"good morning\"."
    cecil "This whole \"bet\" situation was a bit rash on my part, as was including you in this way.  It might all turn out to be a huge mistake, but we can't really go back now.  Besides, this is the most progress we've made so far."
    alex "I'll, um, try my best?"
    cecil "I'm not really sure what that will mean at this point."
    "He says this wearily.  I don't think he has much confidence in me."
    cecil "Anyway.  I need to give you a brief overview of everything before you go into Virtuality to participate in the experiments.  Pay close attention, this is all very important."
    "Finally!"
    cecil "Miss Jin's research, for the sake of keeping things simple, has shown the possibility of using Virtuality's functions to create previously unseen connections between minds."
    alex "Connections between minds?  What does that even mean?"
    "Cecil pushes up his glasses.  I get the feeling he doesn't really understand either."
    cecil "You might have been a little young for this, but when Virtuality was first introduced, it was originally met with a lot of backlash because it operates by tapping into the nervous system.  It wasn't until extensive testing showed it was safe and had no long-term effects that the majority of the population came to accept it and it became the central part of society that it is today."
    alex "So couldn't this new research be accepted eventually, too?"
    cecil "It's not the same.  Feng-er, Miss Jin is tapping into something dangerous.  She's been working outside of Virtuality's natural bounds and safeguards to produce instances where users would be able to have shared or combined experiences in Virtuality."
    alex "Shared experiences?  That doesn't sound so bad-what's the issue?"
    cecil "I guess I'm putting it a bit too vaguely.  In reality, it's more like exchanging or merging consciousness.  Imagine if suddenly you were able to feel and remember things that I do, but in way that makes it seem as though it's your own thoughts and feelings.  Or if suddenly who you are was combined with that of another person."
    alex "Wait, that's the sort of thing she's looking into?  That's amazing!"
    cecil "Well, she hasn't quite reached that point yet, but she's started onto the path to it.  And as amazing as it might be, you must take a step back and think about how dangerous it could be.  This isn't a natural situation the brain is equipped to deal with.  We've extracted some of the data collected during her experiments, and it's shown that repeated experiences could have long-term effects on the brain.  In short, it could leave a person confused or even broken, being suddenly forced to take on the consciousness of another human being."
    alex "But it's all just hypothetical research right now, right?"
    cecil "Right now, perhaps, but I'm sure that if she's allowed to pursue it, Miss Jin will want to bring this to the public.  I'm sure she has fanatical visions of what it might mean for society if people could share thoughts and feelings directly with others.  And while it might be fun to dream about, we must be real, here.  With these new functions of Virtuality unveiled, so too would a whole new host of problems.  We'd be basically saying that Virtuality can manipulate the brain in permanent ways."
    alex "People would probably be crying \"brainwashing\". . ."
    cecil "Exactly.  Do you see now?  People would be driven away from Virtuality by fear."
    alex "So they just want her to stop researching this right?"
    cecil "That's putting it a bit simply.  Miss Jin is very attached to her research, as I'm sure you'll see.  She's already refused the advice of the Board of Directors and gone over their head to continue her work with what few volunteers she can find.  Besides, it's more than just asking for a simple discontinuation.  They're demanding total destruction of every record of it up to this point."
    alex "That's kind of. . .harsh."
    cecil "But necessary.  If word even gets out that these things are possible. . ."
    "I see what he means, but it still seems like a lot to ask.  She's probably put a lot of her own personal time into this project, and then to just pretend like it never happened. . . Then again, that's a lot of lost jobs and confusion if everything does blow up."
    "Cecil suddenly clears his throat and brings me back to the present situation."
    cecil "I suppose I shouldn't say much more, since you're supposed to be the neutral agent in all this, but I thought it necessary for you to understand just what's at stake here before you get too enamored with what she shows you."
    alex "It's good to know what's going on, finally."
    cecil "Yes, but you mustn't forget about that agreement you signed.  That includes everything you're shown in Virtuality as well."
    alex "Right.  Of course."
    "Cecil glances at his watch."
    cecil "Well, that's about the gist of it all.  You'd best get back and get set up for the experiment.  While you're on your way home I'll send you the details for exactly where to go. "
    "I pack up my things while receiving a few last minute instructions that are just varied versions of \"behave yourself around Miss Jin\"."
    "It would be nice if he could have at least a little bit of faith in me."
    #TODO [scene change-alex's room]"

    "Once I read over Cecil's instructions, I take out my Virtuality gear.  Sheesh, it's been long enough that there's a layer of dust on it.  I fumble to remember exactly how to set it all up."
    "While I do so I can't help but mull over the fact that no one ever confirmed that I was okay with all this.  I guess that doesn't matter.  It's not that I'm strongly bothered by it, at least not yet, but I can't help but feel like a pawn in everyone's plans right now.  It's not a good feeling."
    "I finally get to see first-hand what all the fuss is about, but now I'm not sure if I want to.  Am I putting myself in danger here?  Or is it all just fearmongering over something new?"
    "Well, no use going around in circles now-I'm about to find out for myself, after all."
    #TODO [scene change- Virtuality #(blank?) room]"
    "I'm pretty sure I came to the right place. . .I was sent a direct link to the meeting location, after all, but. . .well, there doesn't seem to anything or anyone here."
    "I'm not as experienced with Virtuality as most people, but I'm not a complete newbie with it either.  I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility that I messed up, though. . ."
    "Finally, someone else enters the space.  Oh good, she's finally-"
    "Wait.  No way. . ."
    "The person standing before me isn't Feng or some slightly altered Virtuality version of Feng. . .it's some guy.  It takes a moment, but I quickly realize I know exactly who that is."
    alex "The. . .Silver Phoenix?"
    "He looks straight at me with that overconfident smirk I remember before.  That old hatred suddenly rises up from nowhere.  Like a dying flame given kindling, it flares back to life, bringing a bitter taste to my mouth.  This guy?  Don't tell me he's involved somehow."
    silver "Good morning.  You're right on time."
    alex "Why are you here?  Where's Feng?"
    silver "Feng is. . .not the one you're going to be working with directly."
    "There's something weird about the way he says that.  What's going on?"
    alex "So it's you I'm going to be working with then?"
    silver "Yes.  . . .Is that a problem?"
    "I guess my vitriol wasn't well-disguised.  Must be a bit confusing for him, since I doubt he remembers me.  But I sure remember him!"
    alex "Er, just a little surprised, is all."
    "I had heard that he quit arena fighting suddenly awhile back, but. . .he's doing research now?  Anyway, it's not like I care.  Seeing him surprised me enough to bring up all those feelings but that was a long time ago.  None of that has any relevance to me now-it was just stupid juvenile stuff."
    silver "Well, if that's all then why don't we get started?"
    alex "So am I gonna be observing you doing something, or. . .?"
    silver "Of course not.  The only way for you to understand is if you participate.  Right?"
    alex "Am I really qualified?  I mean, I don't really know anything about Virtuality on a technical level.  Are you sure it's safe for me to do this?"
    silver "It'll be fine.  I'll give you detailed instructions, but when it comes down to it, it's really quite simple-it'll just take some practice to get just right."
    "I can't help but feel like he's being too casual about this whole thing, but what choice do I have but to go along with it?"
    alex "So, um, is this where we're going to be practicing?  It's kind of empty. . ."
    silver "Correct.  It's empty because that will facilitate concentration.  Now then: shall we get to it?"
    alex "Uhh, okay.  Let's get this over with."
    silver "Since you only spend a minimal amount of time in Virtuality, I want to take things slow in order to give you time to adjust.  Normally the individuals I work with are people who do testing for other aspects of Virtuality, so they're a bit more familiar with pushing its limits."
    alex "I'm not a total newbie either, you know."
    "That might have come out with a bit of edge to it.  I guess I'm still a little touchy when it comes to him."
    silver ". . .Right.  I was just trying to explain why things might seem a little tedious for a while.  For today, I'd like to stick to some simple preliminary testing."
    alex "Testing?  Is it graded?"
    "He chuckles a little, but I was being serious."
    silver "It's nothing like that-just taking some measurements, really."
    alex "Measurements?  What are they for?"
    silver "While the real results of the experiment will be something we can experience for ourselves, looking at certain data sets, things like brain activity and physical responses, can prove useful in understanding how everything works-and for looking for solutions if there are difficulties."
    "Right. . .That explains all the different sets of data Cecil had for the initial meeting."
    alex "Okay, so. . .what do I need to do?"
    silver "Just stand right there and follow my instructions."
    "He turns and walks a little ways away from me, then summons some sort of complicated-looking control panel into the room.  He takes up station behind it and then starts barking orders.  At first it's simple things-\"move this way, move that way, take a deep breath\"-but then it moves onto increasingly more complicated things.  He asks me to try visualizing specific scenarios, to imagine various things with my senses; he asks me to do a variety of physical exercises vigorous enough to leave me winded once that part of the testing finally concludes.  I'm not sure how much of this is actually necessary and how much is him just toying with me-I'm not sure what the reason for him to do so would be, especially since it's clear he doesn't remember me, but that slight cat-like grin on his lips doesn't seem innocent.  Not knowing a thing about what we're doing here, I don't really have much room to question his methods, though. . ."
    "Finally, it seems like things have wrapped up.  He returns to where I'm standing."
    silver "There, that was relatively painless, wasn't it?"
    alex "Easy for you to say-you just got to stand there and watch."
    "He just sort of smirks at me and I feel an instant tinge of annoyance.  Even now it feels like he's looking down on me."
    alex " Anyway.  Now that that's done, can we get to the real thing?"
    silver "Not today."
    alex "Seriously?  Why not?"
    silver "I still need to look over the data I collected and calibrate this area based on it.  It will take some time, and besides-you look like you could use a rest.  I promise that things will be more interesting next time."
    "I'm sure Cecil will be breathing down my neck if things drag on too long, but it can't be helped for now.  I exit Virtuality and immediately realize how wiped out I feel.  I don't usually spend so much consecutive time there, especially not doing strenuous things."
    "It's best to just put the experiment out of my mind for now and to try and relax but my thoughts keep wandering to various imaginings of what's in store for me. . .what could this great experiment be?"
    #TODO [scene change, test room again]"
    "Silver Phoenix stands about ten feet apart from me, looking quite serious."
    silver "Now to begin I want you to close your eyes."
    "I do so, but not before raising my eyebrows in a look of doubt.  Seriously, this better not be some kind of prank."
    alex "And now what?"
    silver "This might sound kind of weird, but I want you try \"feeling around\" with your mind."
    alex "What exactly is that supposed to mean?"
    silver "Well, in Virtuality your mind is artificially anchored to a virtual body like it is in the real world.  I want you to try to reach beyond that restriction, however.  This is a bit easier in a room like this where the settings of Virtuality are a bit different than normal, but it will still take some effort.  It will probably be easier if you can relax yourself, first."
    "Relax?  How am I supposed to do that here?"
    "Silver Phoenix makes me go through a series of breathing exercises, which help, but the whole time I can't stop thinking how weird this is.  Where's this all going?"
    silver "Well, I think that's as relaxed as you're going to get.  So now I really want you to try.  You have an idea of where I am even with your eyes closed, don't you?  I want you to reach out to that place, not with your body, but with your consciousness.  Imagine yourself standing right in front of me instead of several feet away.  Try to bring yourself to that place.  Imagine you can hear my voice as though I'm right in front of you, or that if you were to reach out with your hand you might accidently touch me."
    "I don't really get it, but I try anyway.  My face scrunches up in concentration as I try to imagine all this, as I try to stretch away from my Virtuality body. Everything feels murky and uncertain-am I actually doing anything or is it all just my expectation for something to happen?  I don't know."
    "I open my eyes after a while.  This also feels weird, but I've been standing here with my eyes shut for a while now "
    alex "I don't get it.  Sorry."
    "He looks disappointed, but he tries to hide it."
    alex "Is there some other way we could do this?  Like could I observe you and someone else or-"
    silver "No!"
    "His sudden defensive tone catches both of us off-guard."
    silver "Erm, I mean that you wouldn't even be able to understand a fraction of it all by observing or hearing about the experiences of others.  I'm sorry, but there's just no alternative."
    alex "I'm not really sure what to do, then."
    silver "To be honest, I expected there might be difficulties in getting started, but I'm not yet sure of the solution. . ."
    "We both stand their quietly for a long moment.  Silver Phoenix has a curled hand pressed to the corner of his mouth as though in thought."
    silver "Let's try it once more."
    alex "Again?  Okay. . ."
    "Following his lead, I try to relax and reach out with my consciousness once again."
    "I really do try, even if the whole thing feels ridiculous.  I mentally reach out to him, even though the thought of physically reaching out to him is an unpleasant one-I try to place myself in front of him, try to \"connect\" as he says.  I think. . .I feel a little different, maybe?  Or do I?  Is it just some sort of placebo effect?"
    "The moment I start questioning things any sort of effect I'm feeling, real or not, disappears.  I reopen my eyes, feeling a little woozy."
    silver "It seemed like you had better luck this time, if only slightly."
    "Could he tell that because he felt something, or just from watching me?"
    alex "I'm not so sure.  Sometimes it feels like something's happening, but it also feels like it could easily be my imagination."
    silver "Hmm. . ."
    silver "Well, perhaps a few more tries will help solidify it for you. Are you ready to go again?"
    "Truth be told, my head is swimming a bit, but I figure it's best to keep going-if we are making progress somehow, it's best not to lose our grasp on it."
    "I make a few more attempts, straining myself even further each time.  At first I feel like I'm getting closer yet, but it's becoming more of a strain.  My final attempt feels almost back to square one."
    "I hear Silver Phoenix let out a brief sigh of frustration from his position across from me.  He tries to hide it, but it's obvious this isn't going as well as he had hoped."
    silver "Okay, that's enough.  You can open your eyes for now."
    alex "I'm not sure I can do this."
    silver "Please, just stop saying things like that.  If you're already shut out to the possibility then this really will become impossible."
    alex "It's just. . .I don't really feel anything I can be sure of."
    "He's standing there looking thoughtful again, his brow furrowed as he looks somewhere off in the distance."
    silver "Would you mind if we took a small break?"
    alex "A break?  Um, I guess I don't mind.  But why?  We haven't really done anything yet."
    silver "Sometimes knowing when to step away for a bit is also an important part of the process.  We don't want you to strain yourself too hard, after all."
    "I guess he's got me there. . ."
    "The white space we've been working on is suddenly replaced by a different sort of space.  We're now standing in an open office area that's lavishly decorated."
    alex "This is your office?"
    "Silver Phoenix only makes a small \"mm-hmm\" noise as he guides us over to a table in one corner of the room."
    silver "Please, sit."
    "I do so, all the while wondering just why I'm following this guy's lead so nicely.  Instead of taking a seat himself, he leans with his hands on the back of a chair.  He appears to be thinking hard again.  Does he realize I don't really care for him?"
    "I still don't even understand how he went from fighting tournaments to working here.  And what about Feng?  Why isn't she here with me if this is her experiment?  What's the relationship between these two?  Were they partners in this?  I'm about to open my mouth and voice some of these questions, but Silver Phoenix speaks first."
    silver "Alex, do you believe in the ideas behind this experiment?  Do you think minds can connect in such a new and intimate way?"
    alex "What?  Well, um, I don't think I can \"believe\" in it too much since I don't really understand it.  Why?"
    "Seriously, what's he getting at?"
    silver "Maybe a better question would be: are you scared of this experiment because of things you've heard?"
    alex "I mean, isn't it natural to be?  Doesn't it have the potential to allow someone to mess with another person's mind?"
    silver "Alex, look at how much effort it's taking from you just to get a simple start.  This sort of thing could only be accomplished through mutual cooperation.  I'm sure your boss may have filled your head with fearmongering of potential \"brainwashing\" and all that, but it really is laughable when you think about it.  This is not something that could be stumbled into by accident.  It takes more than that---it takes. . . ."
    "He suddenly trails off as an odd look crosses his face.  His eyes widen and he seems inspired suddenly, like a great idea suddenly just came to him."
    silver "I feel as though I've been going about this all wrong."
    "I only sit there with an impressively blank look on my face as he mutters excitedly to himself for a moment.  Seriously, what's with this guy?"
    silver "Alex, have you ever wished to know the true thoughts and feelings of someone you care about, beyond the often faulty and inadequate filter of words?  What if you could experience the feelings someone has for you directly?  What if you could share your own feelings with another in the same way?  What if you could do more than that-what if you could combine those raw thoughts and feelings you both have, direct that energy into creating new things?  What if you could create from the perspective of two people at once? "
    alex "I can't deny that something like that sounds incredible, but it doesn't really sound possible, even using technology like Virtuality."
    silver "But do you want to believe a way exists?  Please, just think about it a moment."
    "He folds his arms and tucks his chin against his chest, eyes shut in a clear \"I'll wait\", gesture."
    "I start to answer back immediately, but I stop myself short.  I don't even know what I would say.  Do I want that?  Aren't the words of other people enough?  Do I really need to get inside their heads, too?  Even if technically safe, it seems like a bad idea to know the thoughts and feelings of another so completely.  But. . .as I think about it deeper, a certain someone keeps coming to mind-someone who avoids communicating with words, either because it's too difficult somehow or she simply doesn't want to. . .Feng.  It would be impossible to count the number of times I've wanted to be able to read her thoughts over the course of these past few days.  I know there's a lot of complex and probably interesting thoughts there. . .I want to know them."
    alex "Okay, so. . .I guess I could see a reason to want to believe you can achieve this sort of thing."
    silver "Then please, believe in it with me.  I can tell you don't care for me for some reason, but please. . .for just a little while, put your doubts away.  I have looked into the science of this-I know the science of this-and I firmly believe that the possibility is there if one does not shirk away from it in fear.  I'm not saying you have to be wholeheartedly behind this, after all your job is to be an impartial judge here, but for just a little while I need you to trust in me.  Trust that it is safe and that it is possible."
    "Even with the scars of what happened in the past, it's not hard to get swept up in all this seeing how passionately he speaks about this.  But. . ."
    alex "I'm not sure I can just get rid of all my doubts just like that, even just temporarily."
    silver "Yes, of course.  I understand it isn't that simple.  Please, also try and think of how many wonderful things we could achieve if we succeed here.  Let a desire to see these things come to fruition guide you, if you can."
    alex "I'll try, but no promises. . ."
    silver "Of course."
    "With this he declares that it's time we got back to it.  We return to the empty practice space."
    " I'm not sure if I feel more energized about the whole thing or further bogged down by all the expectations of it all.  Does he think I'm going to have some sort of epiphany just because he had that whole big speech about how wonderful this could be?  I think he's forgetting that there's probably a whole litany of bad things that could come from it too.  Or is he?  Maybe he's thought about it?"
    "He leads me back through breathing exercises, but I'm still caught up wondering about what he's thinking and about why he's here instead of Feng.  Something about it seems odd-like there's something he's trying to direct me away from."
    "It's time for me to start trying, but I'm barely focused on the task.  I try to center myself quickly.  Earlier, Silver Phoenix gave me some advice for me to try and \"feel\" the stretch as though it were a physical one-to give some weight to it as I tried to make contact with his own consciousness several feet across from me."
    "I take a deep breath and push. . .and stretch. . .and reach. . ."
    "And finally. . ."
    "It's sudden and surprising as my mental fumbling makes contact with something unknown but tangible in the murkiness.  Like stumbling into something unexpected in a dark room . . .I flinch away from it almost instantly and I feel that connection break.  But it was definitely there, if only for a moment."
    "I open my eyes, feeling dazed and as though I had just woken up.  I can tell by the look on Silver Phoenix's face that he understands a small breakthrough happened just now-he looks overjoyed as he strides over to me."
    silver "I think that's a good place to leave things off for today."
    alex "Wait, really?  But things were just starting to work. . ."
    "I won't admit to him, but I really am curious to see what comes next."
    silver "The beginning stages can be quite fatigue-inducing if you're not used to it, so it's best to leave things here for today.  I'm sure things will progress much more quickly after this."
    "He isn't wrong about it being tiring-I feel the beginnings of a headache wearing its way into the center of my forehead.  I guess we'd better stop.  I just hope we won't be back to square one tomorrow. . .I want to get to the meat of all this-no more hand-holding or baby steps.  Let's see what this is all about."
    "He tells me to come back tomorrow at the same time.  It's a relief to exit Virtuality and return to the real world.  I quickly remove all the gear and collapse on the couch.  I was only gone for a couple hours at most, but it felt like half the day.  I close my eyes, feeling utterly exhausted.  So many questions are on my mind right now."
    "Where will tomorrow take me?"
    "Will I ever get to work with Feng directly?"
    "How did Silver Phoenix get involved with all this?  Is it just fate playing with me that I have to run into him again?  I feel like I should be angrier seeing him, but after the initial shock all I manage to feel is the dull ghost of the rage I felt back then. . .I'm actually uncertain whether to be mad at him or appreciate the fact that our encounter set me firmly on the path that I am today."
    "But either way, I still feel the bitter sting of those memories.  The end result isn't all that's important."
    "I continue to mull things over, all the while feeling the heavy curtain of sleep start to drop on me.  Eventually my coherence is gone and I lapse into a long overdue nap."
    #TODO [scene change-conference room]"
    "Before the experiments can continue any further, Cecil soon requests that we hold a progress meeting.  It seems a little pointless, considering nothing of note has happened yet, but I can imagine that Cecil doesn't like feeling out of the loop.  Of course, I have no choice but to agree, but I'm surprised to see that Feng consented to the whole thing as well, since I received orders to pick her up and bring her there for the meeting on the next available morning."
    "The car ride is silent, as usual.  I have a lot of questions for her, but I hold back on voicing them.  I don't know how she'll react, and it would be a bad thing to bring her into Cecil already in a mood.  I doubt she would answer anyway."
    "From the hotel to the conference room, not a word."
    "We take our seats.  I'm surprised to see that Cecil isn't already here waiting for us with several different types of documents prepared.  Are we early?  I glance at the clock. . .no, we're right on time.  Despite the fact that I left to go pick Feng up with plenty of extra time, as per Cecil's instructions, we hit a wall of traffic that slowed down.  So where's Cecil?  He's not late, but when is he ever not early. . .?"
    "I turn to Feng."
    alex "I'm, um sure he'll be along quickly.  He must have stopped to rebuke someone in the hallway or something. . .haha."
    "I don't really expect her to laugh or react at all, of course.  I don't even know why I felt compelled to say something right now."
    "I watch the second hand on the clock make two full revolutions before the door suddenly opens and Cecil clambers into the room, a messenger bag over his shoulder that's only half-zipped and an extra-large mug of coffee in his right hand."
    cecil "Apologies for my tardiness, Miss Jin."
    "He doesn't make any attempt to explain.  Is it me, or was that apology quite lacking in comparison to his careful handling of Miss Jin so far?  I mean, two minutes isn't a big deal for a normal person, but to Cecil. . ."
    "It's almost like he doesn't care as much today."
    "Cecil pulls out a pen and pad of paper from his bag and takes a seat."
    cecil "Thank you for coming today, Miss Jin.  I'm sure you're busy, so let's get right down to it.  Alex, please describe to me all that has happened in working on Miss Jin's experiment's thus far."
    alex "Sure. . .but haven't you read the reports I sent you already?  I thought I was pretty thorough."
    "Cecil seems a little caught off-guard by this."
    cecil "Er, yes, though I only had time to skim them thus far.  Besides, I'd like to hear it from your own mouth."
    "Did he really read them?  Even if he at least skimmed them, shouldn't this case be his primary focus right now?"
    "Anyway, I'd better just do as he says.  I launch into a brief summary of all that has happened so far.  It feels a little strange, putting my own impressions out there with Feng sitting in the room.  I try to keep a neutral tone to it all, but to be honest I don't really have to strain that much to do so: when it comes down to it, I don't know what to think of this all just yet.  Not enough has happened for me to make a judgement either way."
    "Cecil takes constant notes the entire time.  I wonder what impression he's getting from my words.  Meanwhile, Feng sits there with her usual eyes-glazed-over look.  I don't know what she's thinking, either."
    "It's not long before I run out of things to say."
    cecil "Would you say you feel safe with all this so far, Alex?"
    "I give a hesitant glance towards Feng.  I see her move just a tiny bit, betraying her interest in the question."
    alex "Well, I think it's a bit too early to-"
    cecil "That was a yes or no question, Alex."
    alex "Then the answer is yes."
    cecil "I see. . ."
    "Cecil asks me a few more probing questions-\"Why do you feel this way?  Was there anything that made you feel uneasy?\"– such things as he tries to unearth something he can latch onto.  I don't think he would believe me, but I really wasn't trying to deflect the question when I answered it was too early to make a decision on whether or not this is safe.  It's exactly how I feel:  I just don't know yet."
    "Finally, the barrage of questions ends and he turns toward Feng."
    cecil "Miss Jin, based on what Alex has told me, I feel it would be beneficial to have this \"Silver Phoenix\" individual present for these meetings."
    feng "Unnecessary."
    cecil "It just seems that having the perspective of the one conducting the-"
    feng "I have every bit of information necessary."
    "I'm surprised to hear a terse sigh of frustration from Cecil."
    cecil "Very well, I can't force it, but I may press the issue later if it still seems important.  As for Alex's performance, do you feel he has been making satisfactory efforts toward understanding the goals and function of the experiment?"
    "I doubt Cecil really cares, but he probably feels that Feng won't be satisfied with the outcome of things if it doesn't feel balanced."
    feng "He is doing okay so far.  But further success will require increased effort."
    "What does that even mean?  It feels like I'm already trying my hardest to understand.  What more can I do?"
    "I don't think Cecil would take too kindly to me interrupting, but I wish I could ask not only that, but also why I have to work with Silver Phoenix instead of her."
    "Cecil has a few more questions, but it quickly becomes clear to him too that there isn't that much to say just yet."
    cecil "Well, I suppose that's it for now.  I will request another meeting once more time has passed.  I don't want to rush you Miss Jin, but if we could keep things from dragging on too long. . ."
    "She doesn't answer, but gives an almost imperceptible nod."
    cecil "Good.  Now please take Miss Jin to lunch again and then return her to her hotel unless she has any other stops she'd like to make."
    "I nod in affirmation and we all rise to our feet."
    "Feng waits by the door as I double-check to make sure I've got everything."
    "Cecil pulls his bag up onto the table and starts to sift through it only to have half the contents, almost all files, spill out on to the table and floor in disarray.  He sighs in exasperation and begins to collect everything without a word."
    "Geez. . .For anyone else this sort of disorder would be normal for most people, but for Cecil. . ."
    "I'm sure he'll get irritated if I linger, but maybe I should ask if he's okay. . .I can't say for sure, I don't think Feng will mind waiting a minute.  Then again, I don't think Cecil likes people prying into his personal business.  At the very least, I can help clean up the mess."

    "I don't have another Cecil \"pre-approved\" restaurant to take Feng to, so I guess it's the same place again.  I hope Feng doesn't mind, but I don't think she would bother to voice her concerns if she did.  Thankfully the place has a pretty variable menu of East Asian food, so it's hard to be bored by it."
    "We even end up with the same waiter as last time-the guy seems to remember us, judging by the overly cautious mannerisms he immediately takes up in regard to Feng.  He seems almost surprised that we're here again-he probably thought we were a quarreling couple on the verge of breaking up by our dining in silence.  Ah, well, nothing I can do about that."
    "Well. . ."
    "It does occur to me that this is my chance to talk to her face-to-face-er, sort of, since she's constantly finding ways to look away from or around me-I could use this time to ask her a few questions.  It may be pushing my luck a little, but I don't think I can do much harm just by asking.  She'll probably just ignore me and that will be the end of it.  Besides, isn't it my duty to understand as much as I possibly can about this experiment?"
    alex "Say, um. . . Could I maybe ask you a few questions about the experiment so far?"
    "An outsider might think she just didn't hear me, judging by the way she has her head turned to the side, eyes facing forward . . . but I've spent enough time with her so far to be able to pick up on that slight narrowing of her eyes and twitch at the corner of her mouth that betrays the fact that she did indeed hear."
    "Well it wasn't a \"no\". . ."
    alex "So, I was, uh, a little surprised that it turns out I'm not going to be working with you directly.  Is there a reason for that?  I mean, it seems like you would know the experiment better than anyone else would-why aren't you the one showing it to me if it's something you want to defend?"
    "Maybe a bit forward, but I was never too good at being subtle and indirect when it comes to things I really want to know."
    "She still doesn't acknowledge me.  I feel like I would get a stronger reaction if my questioning really was objectionable to her, so maybe I should try a different approach?"
    alex "Is there a reason why you chose Silver Phoenix to carry out the experiment?  Were you guys partners or something?"
    "She perks up a little.  Finally, a reaction-I think I have something here.  Come to think of it, they actually resemble each other quite a bit.  Could they be siblings?  I feel like it would be rude to take a complete shot in the dark like that, especially since family can be a sensitive topic, so I'll go with a more roundabout approach for now."
    alex "I mean, it was kind of surprising, having to work with that guy. . ."
    "A long pause, and for a moment I think I've lost whatever small opportunity I had, but finally:"
    feng "Do you. . .dislike him?"
    alex "I. . .well, that's a little complicated.  More than anything though, I'm surprised that I'm not working with you."
    "She doesn't ask me anything further, but she narrows her eyes and purses her lips like there's a question on her mind.  It's not like I was expecting to hold a real conversation with her, anyway."
    "I turn my attention back towards my plate, expecting that to be the end of that.  And for a moment, it seems that this is going to be so.  . . .Except she's sitting there with an incredulous look on her face.  What?  What is it now?"
    feng "Everyone else likes him."
    alex "What?"
    feng "Silver Phoenix."
    alex "Oh, right, I didn't realize we were still talking about that.  Um. . .I don't know what more you want me to say.  This may come off a bit rude, but so what if he's popular?  That doesn't mean I'll like him, too."
    "She looks displeased at this, but I don't understand why.  Maybe they really are related?"
    alex "Anyway, I don't think my opinion of him is really all that important, is it?  I only asked because I was surprised to be working with him and not you.  It seems like it would be more fitting for you to be in charge of the whole thing."
    feng "You should concern yourself with what is instead of what isn't."
    "A little cryptic.  I guess she means I should just accept that I'm working with Silver Phoenix and not her?"
    alex "Anyway. . .Does he. . .think I'm doing okay so far?  I don't really feel like I'm getting it.  Maybe I just don't have what it takes."
    feng "Your ability is fine.  You need to be more receptive."
    "She answered quickly this time.  I guess I caught her interest.  This is the most I've heard her talk in such a narrow space of time!  I hope I can keep it going."
    alex "More receptive?  Like being more open to the concept of the experiment?"
    "She nods.  I'll count any response as success at this point."
    feng "The one you're working with, too."
    alex "Oh. . ."
    "I don't know if I can really do anything on that front.  Her gaze suddenly locks on me, but only for a brief moment.  It seems like she wants to ask what my problem is with Silver Phoenix, but she holds back.  That's okay, though-as glad as I am to have her talking some, that's not really a conversation I want to have.  I'm not even sure if I could have it.  What could I even say?  How could you explain all that to a stranger?  It probably would just sound ridiculous. . ."
    alex "Did you, um, have anywhere else you wanted me to take you today?"
    "Zero response-not even a nod or a shake of the head.  I guess if it's not about the experiment, she doesn't care to put in the effort.  I feel like there's more I should ask, but where would I even start?  I could fill up an afternoon with all the questions I have."
    "I don't want to overwhelm her, so the \"conversation\" sort of fizzles out from this point forward.  Somehow it feels wrong to try and push for more from her.  I think I'll have more success getting her to talk if I'm prudent about this and take gradual steps.  I'll just stick to what's necessary for now; it'd probably be far too easy to push too far and have her withdraw back into her shell-and who knows if she would come back out again if that happened. . ."
    "I'm content to just finish the lunch without speaking.  Somehow, the awkwardness of just sitting in silence is starting to disappear, almost like I've gotten used to it; it's being replaced with an odd sort of peacefulness.  Without the stress of trying to find conversation, I can just mull things over in my own time and enjoy the ambience of the restaurant."
    "Every so often, I steal a glance in her direction.  I try to keep it subtle, but she probably is just pretending not to notice.  I don't mean to stare and I don't want to come off as a creep to her, but. . .well, to be honest, I've started to develop a fondness for that face...her movements.  She has this way of sitting with her head tilted at an angle, eyes looking meaningfully into the distance; it looks almost artfully arranged-as though she is the subject of a piece of fine art.  But somehow, I don't think she does it on purpose-it's just her natural state of being."
    "There's something intriguing in those soft features of hers-watching the subtle changes in expression as she appears to be wrestling with different thoughts.  If I watch carefully, I can see the moment when her line of thinking changes to something else.  It's unusual-normally direct communication is the best way to understand a person.  But for Feng. . .I feel like there's much more to be learned in the intricacies of her mannerisms than what is said.  I'm starting to understand why Silver Phoenix wants so feverishly to make mind connections a reality."
    "Finally, the indication is given that she is finished eating and would like to leave.  I guess that means it's time to set my focus back on these experiments.  I need to make sure I'm trying my best, otherwise this is never going to get anywhere.  Perhaps I've been a little closed-minded. . ."

    silver "Good!  I think you're starting to get it now.  That seemed more successful than previous tries."

    alex "But this is just one of the first steps, right?"
    silver "Indeed.  I'm sure things will get easier from here on out, however."

    alex "What is it?  What are you thinking?"
    silver "Well, it's just that. . .Although you were able to complete the last task with success, I still sense some hesitance in you that's holding you back.  Are you still concerned about this having harmful effects on your mind, perhaps?"
    alex "Well, I. . .I definitely feel more confident about it than I did before, but it's hard to get completely rid of that worry, isn't it?  I mean, it's only expected when we're doing things that humans can't naturally do.  There's no way to anticipate all the possible consequences, even for you."

    "I am a little curious, though.  But not curious enough to ask."
    silver "Be that as it may, I would still like to put forth this request to you.  You can accept or refuse as you like, but it's my honest opinion that doing so will help our efforts here to be more successful."
    "Something to make us more successful?"
    alex "Okay, fine, I'll at least hear what it is you want us to do, but I'm not promising anything."
    silver "I'd like for you to go out for drinks with me."

    alex "You're just messing with me right?  Quit wasting time and get to the real request."
    silver "Don't give me that look, I'm being serious.  And don't go getting the wrong idea, either.  It's just that from a logical standpoint, what we need between us is a more relaxed and easygoing bond.  I can't think of a better activity to promote camaraderie than an evening of drinking together."
    alex "You're actually sincere about this. . ."
    silver "Of course I am, I've already said as much.  Is it really that odd?"
    alex "You can't just ask someone to go hang out with you like that, especially when you barely know them!  It'd just be weird."
    silver "I'll admit that we are skipping a few logical steps on the path of friendship, but we don't really have time to go slowly.  You want to progress in the experiment, don't you?"
    alex "Yeah, sure, but you can't just force friendship to happen just by spending time together."
    silver "I know that, but I'm not even asking for something as lofty as friendship from you.  I just want for you to drop your guard a little more around me.  Right now you seem as though seeing me in front of you makes your skin crawl."
    alex "I think that's a bit of an exaggeration."
    silver "But you see my point, though.  Will you go with me?  If it ends up as something truly detestable, I won't make this suggestion again."
    "I'm still not keen on this idea in the slightest.  I mean, why would I want to hang out with this pompous jerk?  But it occurs to me that this could be my chance to mine for more information about Feng.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to walk away with anything, but it's worth a shot."
    alex "Okay, fine, but if it feels weird then I'm leaving immediately."

    "The moment we arrive I immediately want to leave.  I didn't stop to think, but aside from being with Silver Phoenix, this really isn't my scene.  I like to have a drink every now and then, but going out to a bar, especially a flashy Virtuality one, really isn't my scene.  I feel awkward and a bit out of place here, but Silver Phoenix seems right at home.  For some reason, he thinks it's okay to put an arm around my shoulder like we're buddies.  I quickly shrug it off. "
    alex "Hey, cut it out.  I already told you that coming here together doesn't automatically make us friends."
    silver "Hey, I know that, but you could stand to loosen up a little.  We're not here to sit and solemnly stare at the wall, either, you know."
    alex "I just don't think this is going to work like you expect it to."
    silver "Well not with that attitude!  C'mon!"
    "He grabs my arm and hauls me off to the main counter.  He was right-there are a few large groups scattered around, but there's more than enough space for each group to carve out its own little space in the bar.  A few people glance our way as we approach, but instead of mobbing Silver Phoenix, asking for autographs and arena fighting tips, they just flash friendly smiles and turn back to their own companions."
    "As we get our drinks and take a seat, the question pervades: \"What now?\" It's too early to ask about Feng-if he reacts poorly he might put up guards against that sort of thing for the remainder of the night."
    "No, I should wait until a few more drinks have been consumed before I pounce.  While drinking in Virtuality can't physically affect the body as it does in real life, those effects are simulated because . . . well, it wouldn't be much fun otherwise, would it?"
    "So I just need to wait a bit, but. . .I don't even think we'll make it that far.  Even Silver Phoenix seems unsure of what to say as we both awkwardly sit there, staring at the wall just like he said we wouldn't be doing and tilting our glasses.  Maybe he'll just call it off soon, admit what a bad idea this was in the first place."
    "Still not saying anything, he starts to take a long drink from his mug.  Beer?  I would have thought he'd choose something classier-definitely not something so robust.  I'm not too particular about alcohol, so I just followed suit."
    alex "So, ready to call it quits?  It's clear we don't have anything to talk about."
    "He sets the mug down heavily on the counter and licks his upper lip."
    silver "Not at all.  I just needed a moment to think.  Besides, sometimes just drinking quietly in the same space together can be a good form of social bonding as well.  But I think what we need now is something to break the ice.  Let's see. . ."
    "He starts to scan the room-what's he after now?  I'm not sure if I like that mischievous look on his face."
    silver "Ah!"
    "He spots what he was after and suddenly grabs onto my arm and starts to pull me away from the bar."
    alex "What?  What is it now?"
    "I pull my arm free of his grip.   I don't know when he got the idea that it was okay to tug me around like a ragdoll."
    silver "Let's play darts!"
    alex "Darts?  Really?  We didn't come here just to play some dumb bar game.  I mean, isn't that a little mundane for something like Virtuality?"
    silver "What, are you afraid that you'll lose?"
    alex "Of course not.  I used to get roped into playing all the time by friends in college-and I used to beat them all by a mile so they would let me go back to studying."
    silver "What?  No way you're that good-you're just bluffing."
    alex "It's obvious you're just trying to egg me into playing."
    "He feigns an exaggerated look of innocence."
    silver "I'm not doing anything at all.  I'm just saying that since there's no proof-"
    alex "You know what?  Fine I'll show you-but only so you can't say that anymore."
    "He grins and proceeds to drag me over to an open board.  I'm perfectly aware that I've fallen into his trap, but oddly enough I'm fighting to stifle a smirk at the thought of getting to one-up him at something."
    #TODO [time passes]"
    silver "Well, I guess you've proved your point, Alex.  I dub you King of Darts for tonight."
    "We set out to play best of three rounds, but in the end it only took two-I won them both.  It wasn't quite the landslide victory I usually had in the past, only a moderate one.  In fact, I have the sneaking suspicion that he flubbed a couple of those shots on purpose.  I mean, he seemed dead-on when he wanted to be."
    "Even if that's the case though, we did find ourselves laughing as we exchanged jabs at each other between turns.  I feel a bit lighter now, but it might just be from my drink."
    "We refill our drinks and take a seat again.  Somewhere along the line, my college days became a natural topic for conversation stemming from our competition.  I try to pull out some of the best stories I can think of-the time the whole dorm had to be evacuated for an hour in the winter because of a take-home chemistry experiment gone awry, or when my floor managed to keep someone's fully-grown Saint Bernard there in secret as the communal pet for almost a whole semester-plus a few other scattered things that happened during those years."
    silver "Ha! That's hilarious.  Please, tell me another!"
    alex "Well, I don't think I actually have anymore.  My well of funny college stories actually pretty shallow, I guess."
    "I mean, when you look at it, those are things I was only passively \"there\" for.  They were things done by other people; I only witnessed them, often only by chance, because I was usually so busy studying."
    silver "Come on, you must have something else."
    alex "No, it's true.  I spent more time getting acquainted with professors and taking whatever work opportunities I could get than hanging out with friends.  It's kind of sad, I guess."
    silver "I don't think so.  You may not have as many stories, but I bet most of them are scraping to find a decent job right now."
    alex "I guess so. . .Anyway, isn't it about time you told a story?"
    silver "Oh.  I, um. . ."
    alex "What?  You've been sitting here demanding one story after another and you won't tell any yourself?"
    silver "It's not that I won't, I just. . ."
    "It's odd to see him so hesitant.  Does he really not have any stories to tell?"
    silver "Never mind.  Can we just change the topic now?"
    alex "Okay. . .Do you have any stories about Feng, then?"
    silver "Feng?"
    "He looks utterly surprised.  Maybe I have a chance if he's caught off-guard."
    alex "Yeah, it just seems like you two have a history together.  I mean, when I talked to her the other day, she seemed almost offended that I didn't like you that much.  To be honest, it almost feels like there's some big secret the way you two are so guarded about each other."
    "I say this half-jokingly, but I can tell from his slight deer-in-the-headlights stare that I may have hit on something.  But what?  I don't think now's the time to make a direct inquiry."
    silver "You're interested in Feng?"
    alex "That's. . .putting it bluntly.  I'm just asking for the sake of understanding the experiment better."
    "Am I, though?"
    silver "Well. . .I'm not really sure what you want me to say.  I think there are better things to talk about."
    alex "I just want to know how you two know each other.  It goes beyond the experiment, right?"
    silver "I suppose you could say that."
    "He leans on one hand and looks vacantly off to the side.  That answer doesn't help me at all.  I open my mouth to open another question but he quickly interrupts."
    silver "Anyway.  I'm not interested in talking about that right now.  We're supposed to be loosening up and having fun, remember?"
    alex "Yeah, but-"
    silver "\"But\", nothing!  Now how about a game of pool?  Darts may be your game, but I think I've got you beat at this one."
    "I reluctantly agree, but only because he appealed to my competitive side once again.  Things return to a lighter mood as we play, but I haven't forgotten-he was quick to turn the subject away from Feng, and even quicker when it came to their relationship.  Related. . . perhaps I should have been a bit more specific when I asked; that word can mean so many things.  I make a few more attempts throughout the night to probe for more information, but he's completely on-guard now, and after a while I'm too giddy to even worry about it anymore."
    "It's surprising how much of a good time we're actually able to have together.  Laughing, trading stories-it's completely different from all our interactions thus far.  The time starts to just fly by. . ."
    #TODO [later, alex's room outside of Virtuality]"
    "I've never left Virtuality in a \"drunk\" state before, which left me unprepared for the surprising contrast of suddenly having the simulated symptoms of that state lifted from me as I return to reality.  My clarity of mind returns, as do my motor skills."
    "Instantly, my mind refocuses.  I didn't learn as much from Silver Phoenix as I had hoped, but that doesn't mean I should count this as a dead end.  Getting the information directly didn't work out, so now it's time to do some snooping on my own.  If Silver Phoenix and Feng really are \"related\" in some way, then there's probably some record of them together online-especially for such a high-profile family."
    "I turn to my computer and immediately run a few searches.  My strongest hunch is that they must be siblings, judging by their close resemblance and ages.  Maybe some corporate photos would provide me with some clues, at least to Silver Phoenix's role in the company.  If I get lucky, I might find him and Feng together somewhere."
    "Thankfully, Virtuality is such a high-profile company that there are multiple wiki sites with the photos I need, taken from various points in Virtuality's history.  I first check through all the photos of Virtuality's research and development teams, across several years.  The teams are surprisingly small, given what a massive presence Virtuality has in the world-but I suppose these photos don't highlight the many grunts working behind the scenes, either.  I scan photo after photo, but none of the faces are the ones I'm hoping to see; no Silver Phoenix, no Feng."
    "I expand my search to other departments in Virtuality, still hoping to reel something in.  Scrolling, scrolling. . .My eyes are starting to burn."
    "Maybe I should just pack it in. . .it would be too convenient to find something.  Just a bit more. . ."
    "I freeze.  A single photograph has caught my attention.  I think it must be a mistake because I'm tired, but I give it a second look.  My eyes widen."
    "Aha!  I can hardly believe it, but I've finally found what I'm looking for."
    "My prize is a photo of Silver Phoenix dressed in sharp professional attire, flanked by several other men in women of similar dress.  No way, I can't believe I actually found it!  It's Silver Phoenix in the real world! "
    ". . .But I'm a little puzzled; this photo makes it look like he's really important to the company-like really, really important.  My eyes dart to the caption.  It simply reads \"Founder Li Wei Jin and his executive staff circa Virtuality's initial release\".  \"Founder Li Wei Jin\". . .as in Feng's father?"
    "My previous excitement plummets.  . . . Seriously?"
    "So it wasn't Silver Phoenix, after all.  As I look at the photo in more detail, I can see the little minute details such as differences in face shape that point to the fact that this isn't Silver Phoenix at all.  Still, the two are similar enough that it can't just be mere coincidence; one could even say that this man looks like a slightly more robust version of Silver Phoenix.  So Feng has a sibling?"
    "I scour the wiki under Li Wei Feng, but only one child is listed.  There are even more photographs of him, always looking stern and hawk-like. "
    "If this is what Li Wei Feng looks like, I can definitely see the resemblance between him and his daughter, but I get the feeling she gets her soft, moony features from her mother.   When it comes down to it, he shares a greater resemblance to Silver Phoenix, enough so that they can be mistaken for each other at a glance.  They both even seem to share that same smug self-assuredness that is permanently etched into their features."
    "Maybe it's just coincidence turned into wishful thinking-my mind trying to force a connection between everyone, but. . . I feel like it's more than that.  Well. . .I still don't have concrete proof that he isn't related either.  After all, there's barely any mention of Feng anywhere despite having such a deep involvement with the company.  Perhaps she prefers it that way?"
    "It's not like I'm going to get any solid answers from staring at this one photo, though.  I browse around the wiki a bit more.  Cecil would be proud-after all this research I could write a paper on Virtuality's history from memory at this point; nothing pertaining to what I'm actually looking for. "
    "I back out of the wiki and try a few other searches, hoping to stumble upon some published research that might include them both, but it occurs to me that something official would probably have Silver Phoenix's real name on it-a piece of information that has never been public as far as I know.  It doesn't matter, since anything I find regarding Feng is published solo, anyway."
    "In short, I turn up nothing."
    "I lean back in my chair with a sigh, admitting defeat.  I didn't expect it to be easy, but I thought I'd turn up something.  I know they're connected somehow, but in what way?  Maybe turning up nothing is a clue in and of itself-like there's something more to this than I originally thought.  Unfortunately, I haven't got a clue where to look next."
    "Well, there's still the direct approach, though it hasn't worked out for me yet."
    "Looks like I'll have to go back to pestering Feng and Silver Phoenix if I'm going to get any answers."
    "But. . .Between the two of them, I wonder just who's more likely to open up. . .?"
    #TODO [scene change, experiment room]"
    "Silver Phoenix asks me to come in the very next day, not wanting to lose the \"progress\" we made that night.  It's not as though I can claim a hangover, so I agree to it.  Besides, I'm actually a bit excited to see if this will bring about a change in our experiments."
    silver "I thought that today it might be helpful for us to try something a little new."
    alex "Something new?  Wasn't spending time together yesterday supposed to help make the experiment we were doing work better?  Why are we changing to something different when we haven't even seen how the previous one works now?"
    silver "Don't worry, this will build upon what you've been doing.  It's just a different way of going about it.  Yesterday gave me a little more time to think about what will be beneficial.  Our difficulty goes beyond forming a positive relationship with each other, I think."
    alex "What do you mean by that?"
    silver "Well. . . If the thought of making an internal connection is making you uncomfortable, then let's focus on something outside of ourselves."
    alex "I. . .really don't follow."
    silver "Let me describe this in different terms:  If you have two artists working on a single piece together, that's called a collaboration.  You end up with something that is a combination of their styles, techniques, and unique skills, but. . .it's not really a true melding of their ideas, is it?  It's still pretty separate."
    alex "I. . ."
    silver "Because!  If it were to truly be a mixing of what they think and what they do, it would have to be done by a third entity-someone who is an amalgam of those two people."
    alex "That sounds impossible-like fantasy."
    silver "It may be impossible in the real world, but that's why we have the incredible tool that is Virtuality.  The potential is there, I'm sure of it."
    alex "But. . .mixing peoples' minds together like that-that sounds even more dangerous."
    "He waves a hand dismissively as if to say \"you just don't understand\"."
    silver "It's a moot point, anyway-we're nowhere near that point.  Right now, all I'm seeking to do is to form a temporary connection of that caliber.  Nothing permanent, nothing that requires a great change; just a quick link that allows for the creation of something new, nothing more."
    "If his intent was to give me something I was more comfortable, he failed."
    alex "Do you really believe all that is possible?  I mean, even for Virtuality. . ."
    "He looks away and his face clouds over for a brief second before being replaced by a gentle smile."
    silver "I think that I must believe it is in order to make it possible.  I have a wonderful vision for the future if I can make these things happen.  I truly want to see it happen."
    "There's something about that grin. . .It's lacking any of his usual smugness, making it a truly kind looking smile.  And though there's no reason for it, but I find it almost reassuring-he really does believe in all this stuff, but not enough to be reckless, I think."
    silver "So, Alex, will you continue to work with me?"
    "I don't really think I have a choice, considering my job is on the line, here.  But more than that, I'm curious:  Is this all talk, or can he really make this happen?"
    alex " All right.  Let's keep going."
    "He grins even wider now and claps his hands together."
    silver "Wonderful!"
    "He immediately launches into an enthusiastic explanation of our next task, which he hopes I'll feel more comfortable with.  It's not dissimilar from the concept he already described: creating a work of art together.  I'm not sure if I really get what he was talking about before, but I plan to do my best.  To simplify it, he creates an easel and canvas for us to build off of; all we have to do now is add the \"paint\"."
    "First, I have to focus on myself.  Breathe in. . .breathe out. . ."
    "Next, he tells me to try reaching again, but this time to the place where the canvas is stood up on the easel.  It's at that point that I'm supposed to \"direct my own consciousness\"– in simpler terms, I'm supposed to imagine the paint on the canvas while Silver Phoenix does the same.  The hope is that we'll end up with something like he described earlier-a work of art that is a seamless blend of our two perspectives; something that could not be created by ordinary means."
    "I still have my doubts, but I know that I need to shut out those thoughts for a little while if we're going to succeed.  I don't think I can do that completely, but I can at least try.  I just have to keep my thoughts laser-focused on success."
    "With the basics explained, the only thing left to do is try."
    "Here we go-"
    #TODO [jump to about a half hour later]"
    "Another failure falls onto the pile.  I feel physically and mentally exhausted.  This one at least isn't a crushed piece of canvas or a pile of paint blended into the color of rotting fruit.  We managed to keep the shape of the canvas time to create something almost recognizable as very abstract \"art\". . .Almost.  What we've created is still a gigantic mess, but it's an improvement over our first tries.  Unfortunately, it seems that we've hit a wall-this is just the same as our last try.  In fact, it might even be a bit worse."
    alex "What's going on, I thought we were supposed to be doing better today?"
    silver "We are!  Don't forget that this is an entirely new thing we're doing.  But. . .there's definitely some room for improvement, I agree."
    "He looks at me, one hand cupping his chin.  He tilts his head with a thoughtful look."
    alex "Don't give me that look.  We're not going out drinking again."
    "He smiles and gives a whole-hearted laugh."
    silver "You read my mind.  One would almost think you're better at all this than you claim."
    "I can't help smirking a little.  He really is easy to read sometimes, no fancy Virtuality mind connections needed."
    silver "No, you're right. Fun as it was, I don't think that's the correct answer right now.  Although, I do believe it helped us to advance to this point."
    alex "Okay, so then what do we need?"
    silver "I have an idea, but. . .I feel that to mention it aloud would be self-defeating."
    alex "What's that supposed to mean?"
    "He waves a hand dismissively."
    silver "Anyway, let's just get back to it."
    alex "Wait, really?  What about your idea?"
    silver "Let's put that aside for now.  It was only half-baked anyway."
    "An idea of his being half-baked?  Seems unlikely since I can practically see the gears turning in his head right now.  We prepare ourselves to begin again, but before we can actually begin, he interrupts again."
    silver "You know. . . it occurs to me that our problem may lie beyond the main focus of the experiment."
    alex "Meaning?"
    silver "Well, for example, if one lacks an artistic eye, such a task could prove difficult for a mind not suited for such things. . ."
    "He looks innocently away, but it's easy to see what he's implying."
    alex "You're saying I don't have the creativity for this?"
    silver "I suppose it's only to be expected, isn't it?  Legal professions are more suited for logical types."
    alex "That doesn't mean I don't understand what a basic piece of art looks like!"
    silver "Sure, sure, but knowing what it is and being able to recreate it are two different things.  I'm afraid this one may be outside your imaginative capabilities."
    "It's easy to tell by his suddenly smarmy expressions and body language just what he's playing at.  This is probably the \"idea\" that he had from earlier: to jumpstart things by reaching out to my competitive side.  For a normal person, realizing this fact may be enough to put an end to any effect it might have, but for me it's like the darts game-even though I know he's playing me, I still want the chance to prove him wrong."
    silver "Perhaps we ought to dial the challenge back to something much simpler.  If we continue, you'll only become frustrated."
    alex "I can do it.  Just give me another chance."
    "He acts as though he has to think this over for a moment and then nods ecstatically."
    silver "All right.  But allow me to alter things once more-if you're so confident, then how about we work totally from scratch?  Up until now, we've been trying to put both of our ideas onto an already existing canvas.  What will we make if we start with no canvas?"
    alex "Why make it harder when we've yet to really succeed?  Isn't that kind of self-defeating?"
    silver "On the contrary, I think it will allow us the freedom we need to achieve success.  Let's still stick with an artwork theme, but this time don't constrict yourself to just a painting.  Choose any media you'd like.  But to maintain some sort of organization, how about you focus on form and I'll focus on color."
    alex "This sounds a little complicated.  Are you sure the other thing wasn't easier?"
    silver "Well, we won't find out until we try!  And besides, I've actually been meaning to test out this idea for a while-it's actually part of one of the larger goals I'd like to achieve with this new ability.  What if artists who work in different types of media could combine their art ways not conceivable in the real world?  Anyway, let's just give it a shot-I know you're not an artist, Alex, but I think you can create something decent."
    "I think that may have been a compliment?"
    "He runs me through a breathing exercise to get us focused once again.  It's amazing how gentle and monotone his voice can get as he does this."
    silver "Now then, let's begin.  Remember, Alex:  You need to connect with me first before we direct it to an external point, otherwise we'll just end up with two separate things.  Got it?"
    alex "I know, I know."
    silver "Good.  Now then-create me something beautiful!"
    "I was all ready to begin, but I wasn't expecting him to throw in that last phrase. Suddenly, a distracting word is caught in my mind as I try to reach out to him."
    "Beautiful?"
    "The connection is made.  I can feel our consciousness minds pressing up against each other, separated by a thin, malleable wall.  If I were to press a little further, I would begin to hear and feel things that do not belong to me.  If we were to both do so. . . what would happen?  Would we become one?  I shudder at the thought and pull away a little-my awareness of his presence slips for a second before I regain it."
    "Create something beautiful. . ."
    "Those were the words he said.  I know it doesn't have to be beautiful, but I can't get that thought out of my head.  What would beautiful look like?"
    "A clear image is already etching itself into my head-an angelic figure appearing to just be touching down the ground, magnificent wings outstretched and arranged in an artful manner, depicting the same sort of grace you would see in an ancient statue."
    "I project my thoughts of this image forward, and Silver Phoenix's thoughts move with mine.  I can't see what he is imagining, but I can \"feel\" it – it feels vibrant and strong somehow.  Are these the feelings of the colors he's imagining?  I wonder if he also only has a feeling that tells him what sort of thing I'm creating."
    "Everything connects and intertwines as it should and something new is created.  My eyes are still closed, yet I know when the moment has occurred.  I open my eyes and step forward to look."
    "It's a near-perfect representation of what I had in my mind, albeit perhaps a little simple.  Perhaps someone with a stronger artistic mind could create something much more intricate.  The figure is painted with the bold colors chosen by Silver Phoenix and looks to have a metallic sheen to it."
    "At first I am excited to see that I was able to pull such an amazing thing out of my mind and I turn excitedly to deliver an \" I told you so\" to Silver Phoenix.  But. . ."
    "He's just sort of standing there, a concentrated look on his face, head tilted to the side.  I follow his gaze to the face of the figure, and I realize:"
    "Though not a perfect recreation, the face and hair bear a strong resemblance to Feng. Embarrassment creeps over me.  Did I. . .?"
    "No, I mean. . .it could just be by chance, right?  I've been seeing her an awful lot lately, after all."
    "Or maybe, it was him?  I mean, I'm sure we both have some influence over each other's parts, right?"
    "Or maybe it was me?"
    "Either way, there's no denying that it exists now and I brace myself for the moment Silver Phoenix starts to poke fun at me for it.  But that moment doesn't come."
    "In fact, the only acknowledgement of it I see on his face is an odd smirk that is visible for only a short moment before it disappears.  He steps forward to where I am."
    silver "Well then, I think we can call this \"progress\", don't you?"
    alex "Yeah, I suppose we can."
    "Somehow my \" I told you so\" would just feel out of place now, so I keep it to myself."
    alex "What now?"
    silver "I think that's actually enough for today.  I would like to take some notes on this in private.  Besides, I'm sure you're starting to feel the mental strain."
    "He's not wrong. . ."
    "I can see that it's not just me, though.  He's lost all interest in further conversation right now and seems eager for me to leave.  He doesn't seem bothered, however, just eager to examine his own thoughts of what just occurred."
    "As I prepare to leave, still feeling a tinge of embarrassment, I can't help but wonder what will come next."
    #TODO [scene change – office]"
    "The following day is I'm to report in again to bring Cecil up to speed on the experiment's progress.  I try my best to capture an accurate summary of events as well as my own impressions of them, all while leaving out certain embarrassing details.  I try to make my words as balanced as possible, but I wonder if I'm succeeding."
    "Cecil listens, his fingers moving at lightning speed across his laptop keyboard as he takes notes.  What's he getting from all this?  Is he still set on shutting down Feng's experiments or is he starting to consider the value of them?  It's impossible to tell from his reaction.  I suppose I could just ask, but I don't think that'd be the best idea."
    "After I finish Cecil sits back, arms folded and eyes closed.  One finger taps against the creases of his jacket.  Finally, he opens his eyes and sits forward, elbows on the table with fingers folded in front of his face."
    cecil "Alex, we need to discuss your hand in this experiment.  It seems as though you've gotten off-track and forgotten the main goal here."
    alex "What do you mean?  The main goal is to fairly judge whether or not the experiment is safe enough to continue, isn't it?"
    "Cecil lets out a long sigh and puts a hand to his forehead as if to say \" you just don't get it\"."
    cecil "That may be the case if there were any question remaining as to whether or not it's safe.  But we already know quite well the destructive potential it has."

Just some artsy dream she wants to pursue.  Think of all the people that will lose their jobs if something goes wrong and Virtuality gets shut down.  She's selfishly gambling with the lives of others by continuing, and it's only a matter of time before something does go horribly wrong.  Do you think she even has any concept of the gravity of what she's doing?"
    "I'm starting to see how Cecil thinks of this \"deal\"–it's all just runaround to keep Feng happy, but he only intends on one outcome.  What happens in the middle is of little concern to him."

As it stands, the longer things go on, the greater the risk that something will be leaked, and it would be a great embarrassment to our department should such an indiscretion originate from us.

    alex "So am I to guess that something happened that caused him to be removed from that position?"
    cecil "Actually, it's more that he resigned quite suddenly."
    alex "He resigned?  Why?"

    cecil "Enough so that he is still receiving weekly therapy sessions to help him sort through it."
    alex "Did something actually happen to him?"
    cecil "Not that I am aware of, and there are no obvious physical signs of damage to his brain or body.  However, he harbors intense fear towards the experiment and refuses to even consider returning to it.  I think that goes beyond mere concern, don't you?"
    "It's a sobering detail, but I need to keep in mind that Cecil is my sole source of information regarding this, and he has his own interests to pursue.  But still. . .just what sort of \"experience\" could this guy have had?"
    alex "Forgive me for saying this, but this all seems a little farfetched.  I mean, I haven't seen anything that I would call terrifying."
    cecil "Yes, but, according to notes I have from Feng, you haven't progressed as far into the experiment.  Whatever frightened him could very well be just ahead for you, too."

I'm certain that his schedule is busy, so wasn't hopeful that it would be anytime soon.  It took some work to get the receptionist to understand that I was not asking for an appointment, but a meeting.  Twice I was asked for my insurance information before the idea finally got through.  Uncertain, she connected me with Dr. Giamo directly as he had just finished an appointment.  My explanations were met by an enthusiastic but clearly older voice that told me to come in after his final appointment of the day so we could speak."
        "I showed up a little early, just as the other staff were preparing to go home.  They ushered me into one of the therapy rooms and told me to wait here for Dr. Giamo to finish."
        "There are a number of degrees and research awards on display in here, all bearing Dr. Giamo's name.  Cecil wasn't kidding, I guess he's the real deal. I'm a little doubtful about what sort of attitude he'll have, though; with words like \"addiction\" and \"negative consequences\" frequently popping up in his work, I can't imagine he's very in favor of Virtuality."
        "I find myself squirming in my seat, feeling almost like I am just a patient waiting for the therapist to come in and help me sort out my multitudinous problems.  I try to distract myself by rehearsing the questions I'm going to ask.  It occurs to me that this is the first time I've been sent to do any sort of field work before.  I've mainly been the office gofer up until now. . . Do I really know how to do this?"

        "Finally the door opens and the doctor himself steps in, saving me from my circling thoughts."
        giamo "Ah, you must be the young man I spoke to on the phone.  Alex, was it?"

        giamo "You don't have to be so tense, Alex.  I'm not here to try and \"reform\" you or scare you away from Virtuality, or whatever you may think."
        alex "Oh, I wasn't-"
        giamo "It's okay, you don't have to be polite about it."
        alex "Sorry. . .I guess I just don't see how you could think very positively of Virtuality if you're looking into things like addiction. . ."
        giamo "In the interest of being honest, I'll admit that my own perspective is probably somewhat skewed compared to that of someone who was younger when Virtuality was first gaining traction.  I investigate the negative parts of Virtuality mainly because I see an area where I can help, but I don't fail to see the positive aspects of it either, especially as a tool for connecting people in ways that simple telephone and video conversations cannot come close to achieving."
        alex "I know you can't talk directly about patients, but could you at least tell me what sort of problems you see?"
        giamo "Well, for my normal patients, it's mainly the case of an addictive personality compounded by the effects of having a very tantalizing alternative to everyday life.  However, I suppose you're more interested in hearing my thoughts on more experimental things."
        alex "Do you know much of the research that Virtuality is conducting?"
        giamo "As I'm not an official employee of Virtuality, they're quite guarded against sharing that information with me, however, in treating the previous tester of this research, it would be pretty much impossible for me not to become privy to certain details."
        alex "So, do you think it's actually dangerous to the brain somehow?"
        giamo "I think it is a dangerous gamble, to be pushing the mind in this way.  It's true that it's impossible to advance in this world without trying the unknown, but in this case I feel the risks are far greater than the gains."
        "I have a feeling Feng and Silver Phoenix would vehemently disagree, but that's not what I'm here to argue."
        alex "So you think it shouldn't be explored at all, then?"
        giamo "I think. . .Virtuality would be better off if it were a better representation of its namesake:  if it were a mere recreation of actual reality and only used as a tool for communication.  But the more the brain is presented with things that are quite divorced from reality, the more opportunities there are to cause damage-permanent damage."
        alex "Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration?  I mean, even when Virtuality was first being tested there were no major issues."
        giamo "I think Virtuality hasn't been around long enough for us to see the full culmination of these effects, however, I do think that the normal parameters of Virtuality are safe enough for the general public.  However, tricking the brain into perceiving as another seems like it could cause a psychosis.  I'll admit I don't have any factual data to go on, but as someone who has studied the effects of Virtuality on the brain, I just cannot recommend it."
        alex "So, in short. . ."
        giamo "In short, I believe that Virtuality has some risk to it as it is.  To push further past what's already deemed as \"safe\" will present more issues, ones that probably cannot be fixed with simple therapy sessions.  I can see what might be achieved through these efforts, but I don't think it's necessary given the risk.  Even if the brain is not directly damaged, there can be lasting psychological effects due to the experiences an individual has that can derail a person's life entirely."
        alex "You're referring to the tester?"
        "He nods but doesn't elaborate so as not to outstep his boundaries."
        giamo "There are just far too many damaging possibilities for me to condone it."

        "Giamo leans forward suddenly."
        giamo "You look a little flushed.  I hope I'm not scaring you with my talk."
        alex "It is a little concerning. . ."
        giamo "It's important to keep in mind that I'm really just talking off the top of my head with this sort of thing.  Time could very well prove me to be just a rambling old man in this case.  Even a knowledgeable background doesn't give one the ability to predict the future."
        alex "I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you're only saying this to make me feel better.  You're really for reality when it comes down to it."
        giamo "That's a very frank way to put it, but yes, I suppose you're right.  Virtuality is often praised for its ability to eliminate many of the barriers and obstacles of real life, but I, for one, don't mind these things so much.  I find there's something pure and nice about just how imperfect and incomplete real life can be . . . but I shouldn't go on any further."
        alex "Thank you for your input, Paul."
        giamo "It's been my pleasure.  I hope I've been of help to you."
        alex "Yes, you certainly have."
        giamo "While I don't know how I was of help to you exactly, I hope you don't let the words of this old man influence you too much."
        "He smiles as though he knows of the inner conflict that has taken root inside of me.  As I deliver one last \"thank you\" to Giamo and he leads me out of the office, I feel like I'm being sucked into my own headspace.  The current situation is only temporary.  Eventually, either Feng will be allowed to continue her research, or it will be shut down.  Is it fair to shut something so ambitious down for the sake of something that might happen?  Perhaps it isn't, but would it be worse to let her keep going until someone gets seriously hurt-maybe even me?"
        "The question isn't the only unrest in my mind.  I think about what lies ahead for me in the experiment, and I can't help but feel guilty for the small twinge of apprehension I now feel."

    alex "Huh?"
    "I look up in surprise."
    silver "You said you wished to use this ability to understand Feng better, did you not?"
    alex "Maybe I did, but how do you know that. . .?"
    "The grin on his face disappears."
    silver "Oh, um. . ."
    "I've never seen him miss a beat like that before."
    alex "Why were you guys even talking about something like that?  That was a personal conversation."
    "I'm on the offensive with him for once.  I get up close to him.  I'm embarrassed, but it's being channeled into hot-blooded anger right now, made even worse by the fact that he's not even trying to explain."
    alex "Do you guys talk about me to each other all the time or something?"
    "Do they laugh at me?  I bet they probably do.  Why else would she tell him a personal thing like that?  She probably thought it was a dumb and cheesy thing to say."
    "He won't even look at me or spit out some lame excuse."
    alex "Hello?!  You're not even going to say anything?"
    "He's like a computer that's been overloaded.  I'm sure he'll regain his composure in a minute and either try to explain it away or distract me to something else.  I'm not in the mood for either.  I won't take anything less than an answer, and I'm obviously not getting it from him."
    alex "Okay, well if you aren't going to talk. . ."
    "I abruptly exit Virtuality.  Not waiting for my head to clear and realign with reality, I start reaching for my phone.  But. . .it's already ringing? "
    "It's Feng.  She must know, but since when does she react to things so fast?"
    "I answer the call without saying anything.  There's just silence for a minute, but I can tell she's there on the other end of the line."
    feng ". . .Hello?"
    alex "You've been talking about me?"
    "A hello would have been better, but I'm not operating as usual right now."
    "Another long pause.  She's probably not used to having to carry the conversation.  Normally I might feel a bit bad for her, but right now I'm too stirred up to care.  In fact-good, she can be the one to do it for once."
    feng "It wasn't malicious."
    alex "Then why are you guys talking about me so much, huh?  Are you guys just planning on manipulating me to get what you want?"
    feng "It's not like that at all."
    alex "Then what is it like?  Do you really think I'm going to be satisfied with you just saying \"that's not how it is\"?"
    "There's a long pause and I hear her take a deep breath.  It feels like we're at an impasse, but to my surprise she resumes speaking."
    feng "I spoke about you because I felt your statements showed you are starting to understand the heart of the experiment.  That's important to both Silver Phoenix and I.  That was my only intention."
    alex "That's it?"
    feng "Yes.  This experiment is dear to me."
    alex "Would you even accept it if this experiment were proved dangerous?"
    "Another long pause."
    feng "If that was the clear truth, then yes.  I won't use tricks or lies to continue if it's unsafe."
    alex "Even if it's your dream?"
    feng "I'd sooner leave it a dream than have it turn into a nightmare."
    "I'm starting to feel calm again.  Maybe it was only because it was Silver Phoenix that I got so riled up in the first place-that guy still pisses me off sometimes."
    feng "I'm sorry if this made you uncomfortable."
    "Woah, she actually apologized?  I don't think she fully understands the depth of my feelings, but it seems like more than I could usually expect from her."
    alex "Er, thanks.  Maybe I shouldn't have gotten so worked up about it."
    "This time she replies almost immediately."
    feng "You wouldn't be Alex if you didn't."
    "The line goes dead and I'm left stunned.  I've never heard her say anything like that before.  She sounded almost like a normal person for a moment.  I guess it's true that I get pretty riled up, but I don't think she's really seen enough of me to say that with such certainty. . .has she?"
    "I want to believe that she was being earnest.  It sounded reasonable enough, but.. . .the way she's talked so passionately about this dream of hers. . .would it really be possible to just let it go?  I can't see someone as headstrong as her being willing to just give up and return to more mundane things.  Maybe she's only able to say she'd let go because things haven't reached a point of desperation, or maybe she knows it will end but still intends to use me to the very last moment.  Besides, just how \"dangerous\" would it have to be for her to accept it as truth that it should be stopped?  There are so many things I still don't know."
    "It would be far more comforting to just take her words at face value and not question them, but I can't just do that.  It all sounded great as she was saying it, but now I have my doubts.  She may not be as reasonable as she sounds."
    "I intend to continue forward, but I can't let go of my doubts just yet. "

I try to swallow that apprehension down so I can focus, but I can barely hear Silver Phoenix's instruction over the roar of my own thoughts.  Everything up 'til now was just kid stuff-now I'm actually at the part where I'm putting myself at risk, aren't I?"
    silver "Alex?"

I can feel myself brushing up against the line between me and him.  I can hear the whispers of thoughts.  I can almost feel what he feels.  But to stay at this point isn't enough.  I'm supposed to push further, to fully envelop myself in these things.  I can feel him pushing towards me, too."

    "I take the plunge anyway."
    "I'm immediately flooded with thoughts and feelings that aren't mine.  On its own it would be fine, but layered on top of what is mine, it's too much.  I feel like I'm being pulled in eleven different directions at once.  I can't find a single thing to focus on.  Everything is so loud, so attention-demanding.  I can't make sense of any of it. "

    silver "Alex, would you like to start again?"

    alex "Yeah, is that really so surprising?"

    "Things just sort of fizzle out after this.  Silver Phoenix's enthusiasm has deflated some and I can tell he's still worried about what will come next.  I don't really have anything more satisfying that I can tell him, so I just leave."

    "The next day I wake up to a text from Feng.  The brevity of the message doesn't surprise me at all-not nearly as much as the fact that the message exists in the first place.  It simply says: \"Lunch – 12:00\". I guess that means she wants me to take her out?"
    "Our time together has been short, but by now I'm way beyond thinking that she's just some spoiled rich-girl interested only in seeing her whims fulfilled.  If she's going out of her way to contact me and request a meeting, she probably has something to say."
    "That phone call was probably a fluke-an attempt to reign in things before they got further out of control.  In the absence of such pressure, I don't think she would be willing to be so direct.  Even her asking for a meeting like this is a surprise. . ."
    "I guess I'd better get ready, then; my mind is already burning to know what it is she has to say."
    #TODO [Restaurant]"
    "I spend the entire lunch squirming in my seat, waiting.  It's only natural that she would want to wait to get settled and receive our food before diving into whatever it is she plans to talk about, but I've almost finished my food and she's nearing the end of hers."
    ". . .Was I mistaken?  Maybe she really did just want to be taken out.  It's probably no fun pacing around a hotel room all day, even for someone as quiet as her.  Maybe I was making this into something more meaningful than it actually is."
    "I sigh and lean back in my chair.  It's just the same as usual: She's near-silent and I have no idea what to say to her."
    "She pushes her plate off to the side."
    alex "You done?  I guess I'll flag down the waitress for the check, then."
    "Out of the corner of my eye I see our waitress pass by and I raise my arm."
    alex "Excuse m-"
    "Before my voice is even audible to her, a hand latches onto my wrist.  I look across the table, shocked.  My mind has difficulty calculating the fact that it's Feng who grabbed my arm just now.  She looks equally surprised and quickly withdraws her hand as though she had just touched something burning hot.  Her face gets red and her gaze turns away."
    alex "Were you not finished eating yet?  My bad."
    "She shakes her head."
    alex "Something else, then?  Did you just want to sit for a while?"
    "Another vehement head shake.  Okay. . . Well, maybe she does have something to say, after all."
    "I sit back and cross my arms.  I get that it's difficult for her, but I can't play guessing games-if there's something on her mind, she needs to just come out and say it.  I avert my eyes from her, hoping that it will help."
    "My ears are filled with nothing but the ambience of the restaurant for several minutes.  The lunchtime crowd is just starting to fill in and the place is growing noisier."
    feng "I. . ."
    "A small voice stands out against the bustle of the restaurant."
    "I meet her gaze.  One hand is curled in front of her chin as she contemplates whether or not to continue."
    feng "There's something I need to tell you."
    "I nod to show I'm listening without interrupting her.  She still seems to be struggling."
    feng "We've. . .talked about my father before."
    alex "Yes, we have.  Is there something more you want to say about him?"
    feng "Do you. . .really understand his importance to me?"
    "I try to think before answering.  It's natural for most children to hold their father dear, but everyone's relationship with their parents is different."
    alex "I suppose the only one who can fully understand it is you."
    feng "This research that is my passion was once his passion, and. . ."
    "She seems to be especially struggling with what comes next."
    feng ". . .And it's the only way for me to truly know him now that he's passed."
    alex "What do you mean?  If he's important to you, then you two were probably close before, right?"
    feng "It's not unusual for someone in his line of work would have a busy schedule, but. . .my father was constantly taking on more and more work for himself because he was feverishly intrigued by what he was doing."
    alex "He didn't ignore you to work on his research, did he?"
    "I don't want to sound intrusive, but I can tell this is difficult for her to talk about.  So maybe if I help her get to it by asking questions. . ."
    feng "Since my mother. . .wasn't there. . .he often had to take me along to work with him.  I was surrounded by his research from such a young age-I observed it, heard about it, and discussed it with him.  Back then I could understand what he was trying to do on a logical level, but that was it.  I did not understand why this research was important enough to consume him.  I couldn't realize his full vision yet."
    alex "He must have been glad to see his own daughter being engaged with his research, at least."
    feng "I think he was disappointed that I could not understand his passion as he did.  Even if I could, I doubt it would have changed our relationship much.  When it came to anything not directly involving his research, I rarely heard from him.  He just didn't have time to devote to anything else-including me."
    "She says all this in a matter-of-fact way, but In my mind I can't help picturing a lonely little girl who had to struggle to keep her father's attention, and my heart aches for her.  It's so far removed from how I had grown up-practically smothered in the love of my parents-that it's hard to imagine."
    alex "You never resented your father at all?"
    feng "I did once, but now it just seems useless to do so.  He's gone. "
    "She pauses suddenly, looking off in the distance as though to regather her thoughts enough to continue."
    feng "All the evidence of his research still lingered at home, though.  I was hesitant to get involved with it at first, but once I started. . .it consumed me-hours of video and audio records, thousands of pages of documents. . .before long, his passion had become mine."
    "It seems almost paradoxical-that a man who had such a great vision for how humanity could understand each other barely even acknowledged his own daughter."
    feng "Through his records I not only understood what he had already accomplished through his research, I also understood his vision for the project's future, and I knew:  I needed to see this vision realized.  Even if he weren't my father, I'm sure I would recognize the beauty in his vision.  It's something I can't just let die along with him.  If he were still here, I'm certain he would find a way to let the research continue."
    "She's watching me for a response.  She's never looked at me with such deep emotion in her eyes before."
    "With the way she feels, being forced to let go of this project would also feel like being dragged away from the father she was just getting to know. . .Thinking that I may just play a part in making her do that brings a bitter taste to my mouth."
    feng "I'm not telling you all this just to gain sympathy from you, you know."
    alex "I know, I believe you.  I can tell this is a big part of who you are.  You just want me to understand your motivations better, right?"
    "And even if that wasn't her goal, I feel for her more than ever before.  What must it have been like growing up like that?"
    feng "It's not just that. . ."
    alex "Is there something I still don't get?"
    feng "There was something else I wanted to tell you today, but. . ."
    alex "It's something difficult to talk about, right?"
    feng "Mm. . ."
    "Whatever this is, she's really struggling to get it out, but I don't think she's okay with just forgetting it.  I'm sure it's hard for her to be saying this much, and it's hard for me to watch her struggling so.  I wish there was more I could do for her.  I wish I could lighten the burden that she feels somehow.  Maybe I can help get her started again?"
    alex "It's something to do with you?"
    feng "I. . ."
    "I'm silently cheering her on so as not to interrupt her.  You can do it. . ."
    feng "It wasn't just that I became closer to my father's research.  It was more complicated than that."
    alex "What do you mean?"
    feng "It's difficult to. . ."
    alex "Go on-you've told me this much already.  Whatever it is, I'm ready to listen."
    "I keep my fingers crossed that it's not anything worse than what she's already told me, though."
    feng "It was about that time. . .that he started to come forward."
    alex "He?"
    "She continues as though I hadn't said anything."
    feng "He looked so much like my father that I suppose his importance to me was only natural-It was like I needed him.  He started to appear even more often."
    "Looked like her father. . .?  Wait, does she mean Silver Phoenix?"
    "But there's something strange, something unreal, in the way she talks about him."
    "I want to say \"wait, hold on a minute, please explain\" but I don't want to shock her into clamming up again."
    feng "Everything was changing-he started appearing much more often than myself and things were getting easier, but that wasn't all.  I wasn't completely cognizant of it yet, even if it was right in front of me."
    "She stops and heaves a heavy breath and I get the feeling she's finally got her thoughts reigned in again."
    feng "I eventually came to full awareness that there had been a. . .a physical change in my Virtuality appearance."
    alex "You mean like some of your features changed?  I've heard it's unusual, but possible."
    feng "That might be putting it too lightly.  It wasn't just that my physique changed or my features shifted a little.  It was gradual, but drastic, and not just a physical change.  I was becoming someone else whenever I was in Virtuality."
    alex "Someone else?"
    feng "Perhaps it was from watching hours and hours of his video logs and spending all that time immersed in his writings. .  .but I realized I was coming to resemble my father more.  Not only in appearance, but in behavior as well.  I felt his self-assuredness and his zeal, things I lacked the ability to express in reality, and found I was able to act on them as though they were my own now."
    alex "I'm not sure if I. . ."
    feng "Alex, please don't see this as a deception, but-"
    "She takes a deep breath before looking me dead in the eyes."
    feng "In Virtuality. . .you know me as Silver Phoenix."
    "Some part of me knew this was where she was heading-and absolutely should have seen it coming-but that part of me is utterly quashed down by the sheer shock of trying to comprehend this fact.  Feng. . .is Silver Phoenix?  How?"
    feng "Alex, please say something."
    "She looks worried-I must have had a deer-in-the-headlights look on my face for awhile.  She's probably thinking it's not like me to be so quiet, but I can't help it.  I'm in a state of near-shock right now."
    alex "I'm sorry, it's just taking a moment for me to process.  So this whole time. . .anytime I was speaking to Silver Phoenix, that was actually you?"
    feng "I-in a way.  But it's not like I was acting.  Silver Phoenix is me, just a different part of me that only exists inside Virtuality.  So, in a way. . .you were just talking to Silver Phoenix."
    "She looks almost winded after saying this.  I'm sure speaking so much at once is difficult for her."
    alex "But still, I. . .I've never heard of such a thing, even in Virtuality.  Just becoming someone else?"
    feng "Silver Phoenix is more of a. . .different version of me. . .so it's not quite the same as becoming someone entirely new.  Still, for my attributes to able to shift so much. . .it's not something most people would be capable of in Virtuality."
    "Oh, right-Silver Phoenix was a mage when he was still on the tournament scene.  I guess the extraordinary mental acuity necessary to be one is useful for more than just battling in the arena."
    feng "I have a reason for telling you all this."
    alex "You want me to understand just how important it is, right?  I get it-really, I do."
    "She shakes her head vigorously as if to say \"no, that's not it\"– or rather: \"that's not all\"."
    feng "I trust you, Alex.  I trust you with this information."
    alex "You trust me?"
    feng "I've had a lot of time to get to know you, and I've found you're an honest but sometimes brash person.  You confuse me sometimes, but in a way that's refreshing.  Others don't challenge me like you do."
    "I've never had someone talk so honestly about me to my face before.  I guess I can't be surprised she considers me \"brash\" given some of my actions around her.  Still. . .I'm glad that it isn't necessarily a bad thing to her."
    alex "You know, it's actually kind of a relief to hear what you think of me.  I feel like I understand you better now than I did when we started, even if I still can't completely read you."
    "She seems quite happy at this."
    feng "Alex. . .Thank you for continuing on with this.  You've become essential to this experiment."
    "There's something about the way she says that which causes a certain thought to strike me.  She seems almost desperate to have me on-board, but is it because she truly cares and wants me to understand . . .or am I just her last lifeline before the experiment shuts down?"
    "Would she be content as long as it was someone?  Is it me that matters, or is it \"everything for the sake of the experiment\" to her?"
    feng "Alex. . .?"
    "My gaze snaps back to her; I must have been too quiet.  I realize I could keep these concerns to myself-let them continue to eat away at me. . .or I could voice them now and get my answer."
    alex "Feng,. . .what do you see me as?"
    feng "I don't understand. . ."
    alex "To put it more frankly---does it really matter to you who you're experimenting with as long as the experiment continues?"
    feng "You're leaving. . .?"
    "She looks genuinely scared at this."
    alex "No, not at all-I promise.  It's just. . .something's been bugging me.  It's probably been at the back of my head for a while now, but I've only just now come up with the words for how I was feeling.  I guess I just want to know if you think of me as more than a fill-in for the last tester you lost, or if you would be fine without me as long as I was replaced, too."
    feng "You're asking if I care about you."
    alex "That's . . . a little more direct than I would have put it, but. . .yes."
    "She doesn't say anything for a while.  I can tell she's thinking deep about this.  Perhaps I should be offended that she has to think about it at all, but I don't think Feng consults her own feelings as much as Silver Phoenix does.  I take the last sip of my drink and wait."
    "And finally. . ."
    feng "I appreciate you because of who you are, not due to a lack of options.  I would not want anyone over you for this."
    alex "Really?"
    feng "I can't keep you from doubting that I'm lying to you for the sake of the experiment-I can only insist that I'm being genuine.  I enjoy all of our time together.  Not just experiment time."
    "A sudden look of disappointment crosses her face.  I guess I must have been looking a little shocked again."
    feng "Is it that difficult to believe?"
    alex "No-not at all. . .I'm sorry, I don't mean to give you that impression.  I believe you.  I guess it's just hearing you saying it that caught me off-guard.  But not in a bad way or anything.  In fact, it makes me really happy.  I'm glad you've felt okay with sharing all this with me.  I've actually. . .really enjoyed the time we've had together, too."
    feng "You have?"
    "A part of me is sad to see so much surprise on her face when I said this.  Is she really that alone?"
    alex "I guess maybe I don't get along with Silver Phoenix so well, sometimes, but. . .you.   I'll admit, you really baffled me in the beginning.  I just didn't get you at all.  And maybe some people are content to leave it at that, but I'm not.  I can see that behind that quiet stare there's someone who has amazing thoughts."
    alex "I still don't feel like I completely understand you-in fact, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.  But want to get to know you better, and what's more-you've given me access to a way."
    feng "You mean the experiment?"
    alex "Feng, I. . .I want to know you.  Like, really know you.  I don't know if you have any desire to open up to me anymore than you already have or if you just like hanging out together, but part of what allowed me to see some of your vision in the first place was that wish.  I can tell that talking is sometimes difficult for you-even with someone you trust-so if there's another way that's easier I want to use it.  I want to understand all the things you're unable to say, and the things that just aren't expressible anyway."
    "Now it's her turn to be speechless.  How did the conversation somehow turn to this?  I didn't plan on saying anything even remotely like this today."
    alex "Well, hey-say something.  Don't just leave me hanging here."
    feng "I sometimes forget how frank you can be."
    "Man, I made her blush."
    alex "Aah, it's fine-I shouldn't really be pressuring you to reply anyway.  I'm just not sure what else to say at this point.  I feel like it's too early to say a lot of things, even if I want to."
    "I stop short when I see her blush deepening."
    alex "Is it fair to say that we both care about one another beyond the experiment?  And that we'd like to know each other better in the future?"
    feng "That's. . .fair."
    "I can sense her withdrawing a little, probably more from mental and emotional strain than actual discomfort.  I think I've taxed her enough for today."
    alex "Okay.  I think we can leave it at that for now, then, don't you think?"
    "She nods emphatically"
    "The blush lingers on her cheeks even as the space between us grows quiet again.  Her hand partially covers her mouth as she rests on her arm, but between her fingers I can see a tiny smile playing at her lips."
    "What I wouldn't give to know what she's thinking right now. . .but I bet it's not all that dissimilar to my own thoughts."
    "I think that something might be starting – something that seemed like a minute possibility up until today was becoming real."
    "I was genuine when I expressed my support of the experiment before, but now, more than ever, I have a reason to fight for it."
    "But now the looming question is \"How do I do that?\""

    "Maybe there's something I can do. . .Maybe talking to Cecil isn't a lost cause after all.  My own view of Feng and the experiment has changed since all this started, so is it unreasonable to think Cecil's could, too?"
    "At the very least, it's worth a shot."
    #TODO [scene change – conference room]"
    "I sit here drumming my fingers nervously on the conference table, checking the clock every few seconds and rehearsing what I'm going to say once Cecil walks through the door.  Already this isn't going to be an easy feat, so I can't afford to let myself get intimidated, otherwise I'll lose out on all hope of persuading him."
    "The doorknob turns just as the minute hand on the clock ticks onto 12:30 and Cecil enters the room with his usual daunting punctuality."
    "He takes a seat at the table with his arms folded, already looking impatient."
    cecil "So, Alex, what is this matter that required such urgency?  I hope you know that I pushed my lunch back by a half-hour just for this meeting."
    "Geez it's like he's purposefully trying to intimidate me into losing my confidence."
    alex "Sorry to arrange for this so suddenly Cecil, it's just that I had some thoughts about my assignment that I wanted to discuss with you."
    cecil "Thoughts?  You insisted we needed a face-to-face discussion in order to discuss mere \"thoughts\".  Why not just write them up and submit them to me as you have been?"
    "I steel myself against Cecil's harsh tone.  This is already a sort of last-ditch effort, but I feel like I'm walking an impossibly thin line here.  If there were anyone else I could have gone to to plead my case, I absolutely would have-it's not that I expect to get anywhere with Cecil, it's just that I have to try for Feng's sake."
    "I take a deep breath."
    "Despite my nerves, I need to approach this carefully, almost like a chess match.  If I go in too hard, Cecil will just shut me down.  I need to be convincing or I won't get him to budge even an inch."
    alex "I requested a face-to-face because I want to propose something to you-something that would be a big change from how we've approached this matter so far, but I feel like it would bring things to a much quicker conclusion."
    "Cecil looks cautiously interested."
    cecil "Go on. . ."
    "My hook is set and I'm getting jittery thinking this longshot plan might actually have some merit"
    ".Well. . .it's now or never."
    alex "Cecil. . .It's entirely my professional opinion that you need to enter Virtuality and participate in the experiment alongside me."
    cecil "Excuse me?  This is more than just a departure from how we've handled things thus far-it goes entirely against our original agreement."
    alex "I'm aware of that Cecil, but if things continue as they are now, we'll just end up in a stalemate.  Are you really fine with that, Cecil."
    "Cecil looks away with his eyebrows furrowed.  He doesn't say anything, but it's clear that he's thinking \"that's exactly the point\".  I can feel the frustration building within me already-I have a hunch that I won't be able to continue this tactful approach much longer."
    cecil "Just what is it you hope to accomplish by this?  It seems to me that this could only be to the benefit of Miss Jin."
    "I pause for a moment, clenching and unclenching my fists as I try to keep myself centered."
    "My initial plan was to try and convince Cecil that there was something in it for him, but I'm certain he'd just see through me.  More than that, I want to take the honest approach-I do believe in Feng and her experiment and I want to support both openly."
    alex "Cecil."
    "I unintentionally slam my fist down on the table, adding accidental emphasis that causes Cecil to jump in his seat a little."
    alex "I want to show you that you're wrong about this experiment-please, just give me one chance to show you what it's all about.  I'm sure that you'll believe in it too, if you do."
    "He looks completely revulsed by my proposal."
    cecil "Are you insane, Alex?  Why would you ever consider this to be a sound course of action?"
    alex "I'm not insane, I'm completely serious, Cecil!"
    "This time I very intentionally try to use my voice and movements to try and intimidate him.  He gives a nervous look in the direction of the door."
    cecil "Keep your voice down, Alex.  This is a professional setting and we have other clients here today-we can have this discussion without you getting all worked up."
    alex "That's not true, Cecil.  If I keep calm and try to talk it out with you-it doesn't matter just how much logic I have on my side, you still wouldn't listen because your mind is already made up!"
    cecil "I am you supervisor, Alex-and this is incredibly out of line."
    "His face doesn't say that I'm wrong, though."
    "I'm riding on the winds of my own pent-up frustration, which is perhaps causing me to act a little childishly at this moment, but I couldn't care less!  This is too important to let go of."
    alex "Please, just look at my face and understand how serious I am right now!"
    cecil "I understand that you're serious, Alex, but that doesn't mean this is the right course of action.  In fact, I think it would be downright ridiculous to indulge Miss Jin at all by doing this."
    alex "But what if she's right?  What if this experiment has value?  Don't you care about that at all?"
    cecil "I care more about the safety of Virtuality's userbase, over this half-baked experimental refuse Miss Jin has dreamed up."
    alex "No, Cecil what you really care about is your job."
    "I didn't actually mean to say that out loud, but I don't regret it."
    "I feel like my sudden outburst is working on him somehow, as he doesn't retort back.  Maybe Cecil is the sort who is so unused to being stood up to that when it actually happens he isn't sure how to react."
    "Cecil sighs and says nothing for a long while.  He's just shaking his head with his eyebrows raised and staring at a spot in the middle of the table."
    cecil "You're so certain that if I enter this experiment myself I'll change my mind about it?"
    alex "One-hundred percent!"
    cecil "I told you to stop raising your voice. I don't care how passionate about this you are."
    "He appears to be thinking.  I can only hope that I'm appealing to his competitive side.  I start to get nervous-whatever answer he lands on now will likely be his final answer."
    "Maybe to say \"one-hundred percent\" is a little overconfident.  I really do believe in the experiment itself, but to hedge my bets on a complete skeptic like him. . .then again. . .I was a skeptic once too, wasn't I?  It seems like a very long time ago now."
    cecil "Fine.  Against my better judgment I will indulge this request of yours just once, if only to verify for myself that this experiment is indeed as risky and pointless as I already know it to be."
    alex "Okay."
    "I hold back my thanks, mainly because I want to maintain my strong position but also because I don't think doing due diligence like this deserves a \"thank you\" when it should just be part of the job. "
    cecil "However.  I won't accept any further outbursts from you.  I will excuse it just this once, but anything further and we will have a long discussion about your future here."
    alex "That won't be necessary, Cecil.  I promise."
    "I can't believe I actually got away with something like that at all. .  ."
    cecil "Fine.  I'll determine the logistics of this later.  Now please leave this room.  I need to prepare for a presentation I have later."
    "I nod and prepare to leave the room, feeling like I have just won the lottery.  In all the scenarios I envisioned in my head, not one among them was me actually succeeding in this gambit."
    "Maybe he's just trying to appease me for the moment, but I have to believe that he's serious about this. Of course, getting him to participate was the smaller hurdle-the much bigger one is getting him to actually feel something for the experiment."
    "I'm about to step out of the room when Cecil leans back in his chair and sighs, a hand on his forehead."
    cecil "I can't believe I'm letting myself be kowtowed so easily. . ."
    "I believe in the power of Feng's experiment almost absolutely now, but I haven't forgotten that it took some time to change my moderately skeptical mind about it.  And to try to accomplish this with Cecil in only one meeting. . .well, it'd take a miracle. "
    #TODO [end of scene] "
    #TODO [experiment room]"
    "It's more than a little tense as we await Cecil's uncertain arrival, although it's more than anticipation that has created a chasm of silence between Silver Phoenix and I in this moment."
    "While well-meaning, I've sort of overridden both him and Feng by inviting Cecil here for this last-ditch effort to convince him-particularly because I didn't consult either of them first, which was a very intentional choice I made."
    "Silver Phoenix has been silent with me as we wait, having just been informed of what I had set up only an hour ago.  I had expected he would immediately reject this idea, as was his right, and refuse entry to Cecil.  Instead he only averted his gaze with a stoic look for a long moment before looking back to inquire if I was absolutely certain about this."
    "And for me, there was only one answer."
    "I'm adamant that this is a necessary action to end this overblown matter in a way that still benefits Feng."
    "I'm aware of how selfish it is to gamble with something that isn't mine-since I'm certain that if I fail to convince Cecil here it will be nigh impossible to change his mind in the future-but a strong feeling of intuition has seized my gut and has all but taken me by the hand, assuring me that this is what must be done. "
    "I've tried not to consider what will happen if we fail here or if Cecil just decides not to show up.  I've decided that those things don't matter because they aren't going to happen.  I won't let them happen."
    "That resolve does nothing to stop me from being a bundle of nerves as we wait, however."
    "It's no small mercy when Cecil finally arrives, looking every bit the same as he does in reality, except perhaps with features that may be slightly more sharp and intimidating than usual.  He's wearing an expression that can only be read as \"let's get this over with\".  Silver Phoenix keeps his distance, regarding Cecil with a wary expression.  Neither of them seems to have the intention of wasting a single moment on formalities."
    cecil "I trust everything has been set up?  You know what you're going to show me?"
    "There's an awkward pause as I realize Silver Phoenix has decided that the weight of this is on me."
    alex "Actually. . .this isn't just something you can watch.  Like I told you before, I need you to participate in it yourself."
    "Cecil frowns so deeply that it's almost cartoonish."
    cecil "I thought my participation would be fulfilled simply by being present.  You should have been clearer in the details you forwarded me."
    "My heart jolts at the suspicion saturating his voice. . . but he doesn't look like he's about to bolt just yet."
    "I know I was clear before, Cecil is just being contrary.  Of course he isn't going to make this easy."
    cecil "Very well. . ."
    "Cecil crosses his arms and sighs.  My stomach sickens a little, but I won't allow my resolve to weaken."
    alex "Okay."
    "I cast a look towards Silver Phoenix, who is unhelpfully hovering off to the side.  I wish he would take over or, at the very least, say something!"
    alex "Now listen carefully, Cecil.  This is what you need to do. . ."
    "I count myself lucky that Cecil's studios and perfectionist nature seems to override his disdain for the whole matter-he seems to listen intently as I clumsily explain.  I try to recall as much as I can of how it was originally explained to me, but it honestly seems so long ago now that I find myself having to fill in the gaps with my own wording."
    ". . .Of course, just because a student pays attention in class, that doesn't mean they'll ace the test.  When I finally concede to Cecil's incessant prodding to \"just get on with it\" and put everything I've taught him into practice, the results are. . .tepid."
    "I'm certain that Cecil is genuinely trying, not wanting to half-ass anything he ever does, but we never seem to even graze the sort of success that Silver Phoenix and I have had in the past.  I haven't been able to glean much from Cecil at all from any of our trials, though I'm not sure if it's a conscious or unconscious effort on his part that may be preventing this.  Likewise, he seems to have gotten nothing from me, despite the fact that I've been fervently trying to communicate all my positive feelings for this experiment to him."
    cecil "Alex, I think it's time to wrap this up.  This clearly is going nowhere, just as I've known all along."
    "I look to Silver Phoenix for help.  I'm not really sure what more to do other than trying again, and Cecil won't agree to that much longer."
    "To my surprise, Silver Phoenix is standing there looking more thoughtful than detached, as he had earlier.  When he notices my gaze, he closes his eyes and tucks his chin to his chest for a moment, breathing in a deep sigh."
    silver " Let me try participating as well."
    alex "Oh. . .you mean, you want to switch places. . .?"
    silver "No, I mean that we ought to try something we haven't before-a sort of two-on-one modification of the experiment."
    alex "Would that work. . .?  Wouldn't that make it even more complicated?"
    silver "I don't know, but I think it's worth trying once."
    "He doesn't sound at all irritated that I doubted his suggestion-for once, it seems like he's just sort of throwing something out there without a solid expectation in mind."
    silver "To be honest, it's ridiculous to expect him to grasp this in only one session.  My thinking is that perhaps if we're both sending something towards him, as long as it's at least somewhat unified, we might be able to get something across.  I don't think it matters who he focuses on-we just need to be able to get something across going one way."
    "I turn back to Cecil, who is standing with his arms crossed, looking like he's about to bail at any second."
    alex "How about it, Cecil?  One more try?"
    cecil "It seems like you're grasping at straws now."
    "I mean, he's not wrong.  The moment seems to stretch on into eternity as he mulls it over."
    cecil "Fine.  But this is the last."
    "I don't think any of us has high expectations going into this.  It really is just a last-ditch effort.  Silver Phoenix is still doing a tremendous job at hiding it, but I can tell he's frustrated with both Cecil and I that this is happening right now-that things had to happen this way at all.  More than that, though. . .he's worried."
    "We don't have to discuss what it is we're going to \"send\" to Cecil.  A simple nod between us communicates it all-what we need most is for Cecil to understand just how valuable this experiment is and that it must continue.  Damn it, Cecil!  Please, just understand!"
    "Oppressive silence fills the room as we all try to center ourselves."
    "We each draw in a breath, eyes shut, and. . ."
    ". . ."
    ". . .We begin."
    "--several minutes later-"
    "Cecil is preparing to leave now and my mind claws for a way to convince him to give us another chance.  I'm certain that Silver Phoenix and I poured everything we had into that one final effort, but it still ended up the same-When all was said and done, Cecil reopened his eyes with a dull look of being unimpressed.  He hasn't hardly said a thing since then, but I don't think that's necessary."
    "It seems perfectly clear that it's over and we lost.  But try as I might, I just can't accept that."
    alex "Cecil, please, could we-"
    "To my surprise, it's Silver Phoenix who moves to cut me off first by placing a hand on my shoulder."
    silver "Alex.  Stop."
    "I'm shocked that he isn't pushing harder for this to continue, but I guess this wasn't really his idea in the first place.  Besides, I doubt Feng intends to listen to any demands she receives to halt her experiment."
    "Still, I was so certain that I could make this work. . . I really believed that I could make even someone like Cecil believe in the worth of the experiment.  Even now I still don't doubt it-only blame either my lack of proficiency or Cecil's unwillingness."
    cecil "I'm going now.  We'll discuss this matter further tomorrow."
    "His voice sounds thick and I realize he's probably feeling exhausted, just like I did on my first day.  I wonder if my eyes had that same sort of cloudy look in them, too. . ."
    "He leaves without saying another word.  I had expected some sort of gloating on his part. . .is he okay?  Maybe he's just having a hard time coping with the sudden exhaustion, but I didn't think that would affect him unless we managed to succeed."
    "I guess he must be saving it all for tomorrow."
    "Silver Phoenix is giving me the cold shoulder, making it clear that it's time to make myself scarce.  Guilt starts to saturate my thoughts.  Why did I ever think this would work?  It should have been clear from the start that determination and passion wouldn't carry this to a satisfying conclusion."
    "We were fighting a losing battle from the start."
    #TODO [Alex's room]"
    "When I arrive home I simply collapse onto the bed, not having the slightest big of interest in doing anything else that day; it feels like everything is going to change tomorrow and this long dream I've been having will come to an end-I know I'll manage to adapt to a return to normal life and, most likely, unemployment. . .but Feng.  After getting to know her better, I'm certain she has a \"'til death do us part\" grip on those experiments, so I doubt what anyone says or does will matter to her-she'll find a way to keep it going, even if she has to take it underground."
    "Maybe. . .I could extend my hand to her and offer my continued assistance.  I doubt that she'll want it anymore after this, but it's worth a shot."
    "My thoughts grow fuzzy as I lurch toward sleep, thankfully giving me a release from my circling contemplations.  At least. . .I have to tell her I'm sorry for messing it all up."
    #TODO [scene change]"
    "I awake the next morning and slowly begin recalling the events of the previous day as I roll over to check my messages.  To my surprise, there's a cascade of them, mostly from Feng and a few from my parents-all concerning an emergency Virtuality-related press conference of some sort that is about to be broadcast."
    "There's no way this is unrelated to yesterday."
    "I sit bolt upright and find that just about every news source is currently primed and ready for the broadcast to start-showing just how prominent Virtuality has become in the eye of society."
    "I immediately recognize the figure standing on-stage, and a chill runs through me.  . . .Cecil?  What the hell is going on?  The scrolling banners on the bottom of the live broadcast indicate that no one else has any idea either.  It's set to begin in four minutes."
    "Cecil would never do something like this on his own, so this was obviously something he was ordered to do by higher-ups in the company.  I feel a sickening feeling in my gut as I realize that they probably plan to use this platform to call out Feng and her experiments-to make it harder for her to continue on her own and separate her actions from that of the rest of the company."
    "Cecil looks perfectly calm, despite all the attention currently being trained on him right now.  I still can't believe that they put Cecil up to this-shouldn't it be handled by one of the usual public faces for the company?"
    "My attention flickers momentarily back to the messages from Feng-she sounds uncharacteristically frantic and is demanding any knowledge I have of this situation.  I send a quick message saying I'm just as clueless as her.  Several seconds later, the promised start time has arrived, and Cecil receives his cue to begin."
    cecil "Hello.  My name is Cecil Garza, and I am the current head of the legal department for Virtuality."
    "He pauses a moment to let this sink in, though I'm sure the introduction is unnecessary-there have been several vicious legal battles involving Virtuality brought to the public eye in the past, along with Cecil.  While, not a household name by far, anyone moderately involved in the tech industry could recognize him. "
    cecil "The reason why I requested this press conference. . .is to bring to the public knowledge of a new experimental application of Virtuality's technology being conducted by a certain individual."
    "And with that, my fleeting hope that it might have nothing to do with Feng or her experiment dies."
    cecil "Before I continue, however, I want to make one fact clear, as I'm sure it will soon come to light on its own regardless:  I am not currently speaking as a representative of Virtuality, but on my own behalf."
    "He pauses again as there are muffled murmurs from the crowd as everyone, me included, tries to understand just what that even means.  Since when does Cecil act without explicit orders?  And what reason could he possibly need to do that?  Why not just silence Feng's experiments behind the scenes as planned?"
    cecil "I was previously tasked with heralding the shut-down of this \"experiment\" for the reason that it could be potentially harmful to the public and damaging to Virtuality's reputation, a decision which I firmly believed in."
    "Here it comes. . .like the blade of a guillotine being raised skyward before the fatal slice."
    cecil "However. . .yesterday I was afforded my first real experience with this experiment, and my mind was changed quite dramatically."
    ". . .Huh?"
    cecil "Now, the details of the experiment are thus-"
    "I can't even focus as Cecil lays out a thorough description of Feng's experiment.  His mind was changed?  How is that possible-his attitude upon leaving yesterday indicated everything to the contrary!"
    "I mean, he's certain to lose his job and probably have serious charges pressed against him for this action."
    "What could have happened between then and now to cause him to do such a thing?  It makes no sense!"
    "Unless. . ."
    ". . .No, I don't want to think about it just yet."
    "I zero in on Cecil.  There's something about him right now that's bugging me."
    "There's no doubt in my mind that that is, in fact, the real Cecil and not some imposter, but he just doesn't look \"right\" somehow.  There's an oddly soft and unfocused look in his eyes-an eerie gleam to them that could, perhaps, only be a trick of the lighting. . .but I don't think it is."
    "There's something in his expression that is decidedly not Cecil."
    "My stomach clenches and I break into a cold sweat as I continue to stare at Cecil on-screen as he expounds the virtues of Feng's experiments as enthusiastically as I might if given the chance."
    "\"As I might\". . ."
    "Cecil saying his mind has been changed on the matter suddenly has a very different ring to it."
    "The thought that I've been trying to mentally bat away fully seizes me now and I can't escape it.  I can't take my eyes off the screen, either."
    "Yesterday I had so desperately wanted to impart my passion for the experiment, knowing it was probably our last chance.  I'm sure it was the same for Silver Phoenix, even if he didn't let on."
    cecil "My reason for bringing this to the public today, is the fear that this experiment will be silently and efficiently smothered by Virtuality otherwise.  I want to give it a chance at thriving."
    "So is it possible in our final try that we. . ."
    cecil "It is imperative, in my opinion, that this experiment be allowed to continue, because-"
    "A sinking feeling settles into the pit of my stomach."

    "I can't get my conversation with Feng out of my mind."
    "It isn't even the content of the conversation that I'm caught up on-though that hasn't been the easiest to grasp-it was her voice and the expressions she made while saying it.  She's never been so vulnerable and open with me as she has in that moment."
    ". . .But that's the catch, isn't it?  What I got from her this afternoon was a rare and temporary thing, not a permanent step forward.  By the time I had dropped her off at the hotel, her usual reticence had returned in full."
    "But maybe. . .maybe it doesn't have to be like this.  Maybe I can keep things going."
    "I pull out my phone in a burst of excitement, my heart thumping."
    "I've never tried to push for a closer relationship with Feng yet so far, but why not now?  What if our conversation earlier was also an invitation to do so, and now the ball's in my court?"
    "Calling her would be too forward, I think.  Besides, she might be sleeping.  I'll just send her a text and see what happens."

    "I stare at the blank text message box, my sudden excitement waning as reality sets in."
    "I don't know how to do this."
    "All I know how to talk to her about is the experiment.  She probably isn't interested in talking in anything else-I'm just kidding myself."
    "Well. . .maybe I should at least try.  I'd like to talk to her about other things, but I think the experiment is a good starting point-after all, today's conversation was a bombshell, and I still have a lot of questions."
    "Several minutes of furious writing and rewriting and rewriting again. . .I finally have a modest message to send to her:"
    "Feng, I was hoping we could continue our conversation from earlier.  I know it's a difficult subject, but I want to know more so I can help."
    "A much more formal tone than I would take with anyone else, but I feel like Feng would like the directness.  She seems to not like wasting time on pointless banter.  I can't help but feel a twinge of worry, though.  Am I being too forward by making my interest so plain?  Will it make her suspicious of me?  Or will this sort of frankness make her see me as an ally she can trust?  It's impossible to tell."
    "I mull over the message for several more minutes, making minute changes and then undoing them.  Finally, I force myself to send it, effectively taking the matter out of my hands.  I try to comfort myself with the fact that if I'm making the wrong choice, Feng is more likely to see my action as irritating rather than awkward."
    "I flop onto my bed, knowing that it'll be impossible to do concentrate on anything else while I wait for a reply."
    "And so I wait, jumping at every occasional notification, all of them turning out to be meaningless-spam messages, social media notifications, and so on. . ."
    "*yawn* I'm sure she'll get back to me when she's free."
    ". . ."
    "I jolt upward when something clatters onto the floor, realizing I must have fallen asleep while waiting.  A quick glance at the sky outside, now brightening with sunrise, proves that I really fell asleep."
    "Surely, she must have replied by now!"
    "With fresh excitement, I check for messages only to be quickly disappointed."
    "A few from online stores and financial alerts and a message from a distant friend-nothing from Feng."
    "I sit up with a sigh."
    "I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that she didn't answer, but I wish I knew why.  Is she not interested in saying anything more?  Does she not have anything more to say?  Does she want to, but can't?  Was it too soon to push for more?"
    ". . .I need to stop, but my mind keeps generating new questions and possibilities.  I'm not going to come up with the right one just by thinking about it-I need to find a different path forward."
    "An idea hits me suddenly; one which I'm amazed I didn't think of before."
    "Duh!  I can just ask Silver Phoenix these questions!  I've never known him to be particularly reticent with any sort of information.  In fact, much to my annoyance, he's usually quite the motormouth."
    "This approach doesn't just benefit me, either.  By talking to Silver Phoenix instead, I'll save Feng the stress of talking about it and our interactions will probably go smoother in the future.  And if they truly are the same person, then Silver Phoenix ought to be able to give me all the answers I need-maybe even more!"
    "No matter how you think about it, it's a great idea."
    "I'm thankful that today is an experiment day-I'm anxious to try out my new approach."

    "Today, Silver Phoenix insisted that our usual tea and snack break be an impromptu arts-and-crafts session, with a focus on paper folding.  It seems like a mundane thing to be doing in a setting like Virtuality, but he makes it anything but.  I watch him as he makes impossibly intricate animals and structures from paper, churning them out en masse.  He doesn't even seem to be using a template-just creating.  Meanwhile, I hopelessly ruin sheet after sheet of paper trying to fold a simple crane according to his directions."
    "On a normal day I would refuse to participate in his antics, but I'm trying to stay on his good side as I look for a segue into my intended conversation topic.  All the while, the papercraft civilization grows around him."
    "I don't think the perfect segue will ever arrive, so I'll just have to settle with a lull in the conversation."
    "I clear my throat and he looks up, sensing a shift in tone."
    alex "Um. . ."
    "He looks at me expectantly while I clamber for something to say.  Despite thinking about it constantly before arriving at this moment, I never figured out just how I wanted to say this."
    alex "Could we maybe. . .talk about Feng some?  I have a few questions about her that I thought maybe you could help shed some light on."
    "I thought that was a nice, safe intro, but a smile quirks at the corner of his mouth."
    silver "Sure-and then after we could talk about Alex some."
    alex ". . .Huh?"
    "He chuckles and I feel a flush of embarrassment without quite understanding why."
    silver "I don't mean to mock you, Alex, but I don't think you get it yet.  I'm not not Feng-I'm just the more Silver Phoenix-ish version of her right now."
    alex "Okay, now I really don't get it."
    silver "If you wake up in a bad mood, do you wake up a different person or do you wake up as Alex, who just also happens to be in a bad mood right now?"
    alex "Those just don't seem to be the same to me."
    "He sighs, looking weary."
    silver "Just picture a bar with Silver Phoenix at one end and Feng at the other-two options, but only one bar.  It's as simple as that.  Quite frankly I'm disappointed that you're not getting it more."
    alex "All right, so ignoring all that-the fact is, that you're saying I can't talk to you about Feng."
    silver "I'm saying that it's weird to ask someone about themselves like that.  If you want to talk, then talk to me!"
    "He rests his chin on his hands and leans across the table, giving me his full attention.  Meanwhile, I try to calculate the most tactful way to respond."
    "Then I decide to through tactful out the window and just be straight with him."
    alex "Okay, you and Feng are the same-but that doesn't change the fact that Feng is the one I want to talk to."
    silver "And yet you're here talking to me, whom you decidedly believe is not equivalent to Feng."
    "He pouts, but I can tell it's forced.  He quickly follows it up with a smile."
    alex "I tried Feng first, but she didn't respond to me."
    "His eyebrows knit and he looks confused for a split second before flashing back to smarmy.  Is it possible Feng didn't even see my message yet?"
    alex "Please, I just want to know how to talk to Feng better."
    silver "I think \"talk to\" is a bit of a cop-out."
    alex "What do you mean by that?"
    "I'm aware that my voice immediately jumped to a guarded tone.  Silver Phoenix wags a finger at me and winks."
    silver "It's obvious, isn't it?  What you want is more than just talking.  You want a D-A-T-E."
    "I'm stunned into silence, but there's no use denying it."
    "I feel like this whole \"Feng = Silver Phoenix\" thing would be a lot easier to take if he was anything like her.  I mean, how can I believe that this smarmy, forthright ass in front of me is also demure and cautious Feng?"
    "If I want to get anything out of this, I'm gonna have to play on his terms."
    alex "Okay.  Fine.  I want more than just talking."
    "He pouts again and I can tell that that admission isn't good enough."
    alex "Okay, okay, okay.  I want a date."
    "A smile alights on his face and he pops up from his seat.  He extends a hand to me in an elegant way."
    "I just stare at it, confused."
    alex "Uhhh. . ."
    silver "You said you wanted a date, so let's go."
    alex "Not you!  Feng!"
    "He sits back down, arms crossed, and turns his gaze away from me like a sulking cat.  The smile twitching at the corner of his mouth, though, gives him away.  I guess being the same as Feng means he can't truly be offended."
    alex "Maybe we should shelve this conversation.  I'm not really sure where it's going anymore."
    "I'll just have to figure things out for myself-or just accept that maybe Feng isn't interested."
    silver "You're right, we ought to get back to work so we don't run over today."
    "I didn't actually expect him to agree with me.  Since when does he want to finish up on time?"
    "I stand, somehow feeling worn out by that conversation and partially regretting starting it in the first place.  Maybe I'm deluding myself by thinking my wishes align with Feng's.  Maybe I don't deserve her time if I can't fully grasp the dichotomy of her and Silver Phoenix."
    "Silver Phoenix remains sitting."
    alex "You ready or not?"
    "He appears to be thinking intently on something.  After a moment he looks up at me with a soft smile.  A smile that reminds me intensely of Feng."
    silver "You should relax a little, Alex.  You worry too much."
    "I blink in stunned silence.  Is it reasonable to be so confused by such a simple declaration?"
    alex "I'll try."
    "The classic Silver Phoenix smirk returns and I'm left wondering what just happened.  He's not wrong, though-I could probably benefit from thinking a little less and doing a little more.  Or at the very least, thinking without letting my fears intercede."
    "Thinking more objectively, I already have my answer, don't I?  I doubt Silver Phoenix would be so forthcoming if talking to Feng would produce a flat-out \"no\". . .Probably."
    "When it comes down to it, I don't think I have a good grasp on any of this just yet.  My conjecture means pretty much nothing if I don't understand the machinations."
    "Well!  Nothing for it but to keep pushing forward and puzzling things out.  If nothing else, my determination has returned.  As soon as I get home, I'll figure out my next move!"
    #TODO [The park]"
    "I got a text from Feng shortly after our Virtuality meeting, but it's not exactly what I wanted.  It didn't really say anything, only included the address of a small local park, tomorrow's date and a time.  Oookay."
    "Obviously, I understood that I was meant to show up at that time and place, hence why I am here now, but I wish I knew the reason.  I sent an inquiry to that effect back, but got no reply-not that I was surprised by this."
    "I also showed up insanely early, unable to deal with the anticipation.  I was hoping Feng might be there early too, but it seems like the only thing I accomplished was transplanting my nervous energy to the park along with me."
    "The park is small enough that a specific meeting spot isn't necessary-No matter where she arrives from, I'm sure to see her and she's sure to see me from this bench I'm sitting on.  I check the time; just a few minutes and she should be here. . .hopefully."
    "As I wait, I begin to get increasingly worried that perhaps I was meant to pick her up.  I'm sure she's capable of getting here without me, but sometimes it feels like she expects me to be a mind-reader to make up for what she can't say."
    "Just another minute and she'll be late.  Feng isn't the sort of person to be late.  Should I. . .should I call her?  In the back of my head I'm aware that my heart is beating nervously.  Is it because I'm afraid of missing her or in anticipation of seeing her?"
    "I crane my neck all around to see if I can spot her.  Not there. . .not there. . .not-"
    "The other half of the bench creaks as someone slides onto it.  I whip my head around."
    feng ". . ."
    alex "Hey. . .Feng."
    "I try to mask the start she just gave me-how'd she manage to sneak up on me like that?"
    alex "So. . .what's up?  Did you need something from me?"
    "I'm not really sure how to talk to her in this setting-all of her interactions thus far have had at least some semblance of business attached to them.  This situation, however, is completely new."
    "Unfortunately, she does nothing to help me out.  Her answer to my question is a mere shrug.  Am I mistaken, or is there a small smile in there?"
    alex "Okaaay.  Am I supposed to figure it out?"
    "This time she's blushing and messing around on her comm."
    alex "Okay, umm. . ."
    alex "Is there something you need me to do for you?"
    feng "No."
    alex "Something you want to talk about?"
    feng "No."
    alex "Something you need help with?"
    feng "No."
    "Her responses come without ever looking up at me."
    "If it were anyone else I was talking to, I'd be getting pretty frustrated.  But with Feng, I'm finally starting to understand that her clipped responses aren't rudeness or disinterest, just efficiency."
    alex "Can you just tell me why you wanted me to meet you here?"
    feng "Not me.  You."
    alex "I wanted to meet here?"
    "I wrack my brain trying to figure out when I might have said something like that and come up empty.  I might not be frustrated with Feng, but she sure is starting to look frustrated with me-in her minimal-affect way, of course."
    alex "Okay, so I said I wanted to meet you here. . .Can you remind me of when that was?"
    "If she were a cat, her ears would have just flicked in annoyance."
    alex "I'm sorry I'm not getting it, Feng.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Just give me a little help, okay?"
    feng "Yesterday."
    alex "Yesterday. . .?  But we didn't-Oh.  OH."
    "A sudden dawning realization hits me."
    alex "Feng. . .is this. . ."
    "I choke on the question a little."
    alex "Is this a date?"
    "I can practically see her cringing into herself at the mention of the word \"date\", but I'm not sure if it's the word or because my voice cracked a little."
    feng "You said \"I want a date\"."
    alex "I guess I just. . .I don't know.  I didn't think you were interested."
    "She doesn't respond, so I feel compelled to keep tripping over my words."
    alex "Don't get me wrong, I'm glad!  I'm just surprised is all."
    "From here, you would think that the \"date\" would really begin to take off now that both parties are actually informed that that is what it is. . .but what happens is more like me sitting in mystified silence for several seconds while she taps away at her comm.  I don't really know what to do now.  I didn't think I'd get this far.  It's been so long since I've been on a date that I don't even remember what a normal date is supposed to look like."
    alex "So. . .you, um. . .you like parks?"
    "Terrible."
    feng "I don't dislike them."
    alex "Oh-I saw a little duck pond over there.  Do you want to go sit by that instead?"
    feng "Here is fine."
    alex "Okay. . ."
    "C'mon, Alex-think of date stuff."
    alex "There's a little food pavilion, too.  You hungry?  My treat."
    feng "I ate."
    alex "Thirsty, maybe?  I think they have smoothies."
    "She lifts up a bottle of water she brought with her."
    alex "Oh."
    "I slump down on the bench and lapse into silence."
    "Feng hasn't looked at me once since she sat down.  She just keeps messing around on the comm.  I should be glad that she's even here with me right now, but seriously. . .why give me a date if she's just going to ignore me?"
    alex "You doing some work on there, or. . .?"
    "I try to waft a subtle hint that I'd like her to put it down for now, but I'm not sure if she doesn't get it or doesn't care."
    alex "Maybe we could just take a little walk around or something.  It's not really much of a date if we're just sitting here in silence while you play around on your comm."
    "Oops, I think a bit of my frustration leaked out.  That sounded kind of sulky."
    "But it does get her to stop tapping on the comm for the moment.  Instead she stares forward, her long hair draped in such a way that obscures much of her face."
    feng "You wanted a date.  I'm not good at dates.  What did you expect?"
    "I'm a bit taken aback at this.  I don't think she meant it to, but it sounded very accusatory."
    alex "I mean, I'm not good at dates either."
    "I laugh nervously, hoping to lighten the mood."
    alex "I just figured that maybe we could be bad at dates together.  You know, just. . .talking?"
    feng "Then talk to me as Silver Phoenix.  It's easier for both of us that way."
    alex "I already told you.  I don't want to talk to Silver Phoenix, I want to talk to Feng."
    feng "Feng doesn't talk.  Not like you want.  Aimless conversation is unnecessary to me."
    "I have to take a deep breath because I can feel my blood pressure rising.  I also swallow down the urge to stand and shout \"well, you're talking just fine right now!\".  I feel like we're hurtling towards a one-sided argument, which isn't really something I want to be responsible for starting."
    alex "Feng, I. . .thank you for trying, but I think we should call it quits for today.  I'm not sure if this is working out.  I'm sure you're tired of putting yourself through this, so I'll leave you be."
    "I want to say that I see a flicker of disappointment in her profile, but that might just be wishful thinking.  Maybe it was relief.  Or nothing at all."
    "I stand up and linger for a minute, waiting for some sort of reaction-for her to say something, or look at me, or stand to go herself."
    "She does none of those things, so in the end I just. . .walk away.  All the while, I'm berating myself for messing this up so badly.  I may have gotten frustrated with her, but I feel like the problem is almost entirely on me-I mean, I should I have known from the start that a date with Feng wouldn't be the same as a date with anyone else; trying to mold it into one was nothing short of a recipe for disaster."
    "I just wish there was some sort of middle ground where Feng can be Feng but there can be more than just curt replies and awkward silence.  But the more I think about it, the more it seems like a winless situation.  It seems like I'm letting my feelings for Feng cloud my vision of reality.  I don't see how I can reconcile those two things right now-I really don't."
    "I wish I were better at this."
    #TODO [alex's room]"
    "When I get home, I try to distract myself from thinking about the first date misfire that just occurred, but it's no good.  I've never been good at putting off problems that are right in front of me-especially when it feels like there's something I can do to solve it!"
    "And this proves to be true-with only a moment of dedicated thought, I come up with a probable solution:"
    "I can just ask Silver Phoenix again.  Trying to have a serious conversation with him last time might have been a little irritating, but at least he was able to nudge things in the right direction.  I'm sure he'll be able to tell me where I went wrong and what I could do better."
    "I don't want to ask any more of Feng at this point.  I feel like she's already trying her best just by showing up-I need to meet her halfway before it would be fair to expect more from her.  I know she didn't mean to be rude by playing on the comm like that or by deflecting my conversation attempts-it's just her way of being.  But I also know that sitting together in isolative silence won't work for me. . .so there's gotta be some kind of middle ground I can hope to reach."
    "It's decided.  I'll ask Silver Phoenix next time I see him.  Maybe then I can put together a few more pieces of the puzzle that is interacting with Feng."
    "I'm actually feeling a little thrilled just thinking about it."
    #TODO [experiment room]"
    silver "I think it's time we ended our collaboration on this experiment, Alex."
    alex ". . .Huh?"
    "My brain can't seem to process the words-they're so unexpected that they might as well be in an alien language.  I showed up expecting a normal workday, only to be met with a solemn-faced Silver Phoenix and. . .this."
    silver "I'm saying that your service is no longer needed after today."
    alex "I don't understand. . .why would you want to quit all of a sudden?  I thought this was incredibly important to you?"
    "He stares at me a long moment, seeming to be considering something."
    silver "Alex, I'm going to be honest with you because you've proven trustworthy so far.  I am not saying that this is the end of the experiment as a whole-only an end to our collaboration on it.  Recall exactly why you are here, Alex."
    "Of course I haven't forgotten.  But. . .none of my interactions with Cecil have given me any indication that Feng had \"won\" the bet."
    alex "So. . .you got permission to continue?"
    silver "No. . .not exactly."
    silver "Let's be real, Alex-There was never any \"bet\".  A bet would imply that there's a fair chance for either side to succeed.  But. . . there was never any actual chance for me to succeed-not really.  It was all just a façade, and an extremely transparent one, at that.  This was only an attempt to placate me and coerce me into accepting their decision."
    "Was I naïve for ever thinking that it was otherwise?  Or is this all just hyperbole from Feng's perspective.  No. . .I have to believe that it's the former."
    alex "But you don't intend to quit, do you?  No matter what they say."
    silver "Of course not.  And when it comes down to it, there's not much they can do to stop me.  I'll find a way to continue."
    alex "Then can't I continue with you, too?"
    silver "Why, Alex?"
    "He looks at me sternly."
    silver "Can you truly say that you have a sincere interest in the progression of this experiment?  . . .Or is it really a sincere interest in Feng?"
    "I open my mouth to speak, but pull myself back, knowing that he won't appreciate an empty sentiment.  I want to say \"both\"-I wish I could say both."
    ". . .But. . .If I'm truly honest. . .the only truthful answer is Feng.  I know that I believe in the experiment and its potential and that I want it to succeed. . .but those feelings are all because of Feng.  They're for Feng.  I don't feel like I'm right for this experiment, nor do I feel the need to be such an intimate part of it like she does.  I want to support her, but not like that.  At least, that's what I think my feelings are telling me."
    "I take a deep breath and meet Silver Phoenix eye-to-eye."
    "He smiles and nods."
    silver "It's okay."
    alex "Can I. . .can we just try one more time?  I just want to be sure."
    "More than that, I'm scared of what it will mean if I'm shut out of the experiment."
    silver "Of course, Alex.  I did say \"after today\", after all.  Let's get started."
    "We start preparing, but I'm such a bundle of nerves right now that I can't concentrate."
    "If I stop now, will Feng lose interest in me?"
    "What if. . .what if I messed things up so badly with the date that she's ready to wash her hands of me?"
    silver "Alex, you need to focus or there's no point in us doing this."
    "How can I focus when there's so much pressure right now?  If I don't impress him, he won't need me anymore.  Feng won't need me anymore."
    silver "Deep breaths, Alex.  Four seconds in. . .now hold for four seconds. . .now out. . .now hold."
    "I try to follow along with our normal procedure, but it's no good.  All I can manage is an unconvincing facsimile of what I'm supposed to be doing.  Eventually, it's time to begin, except I don't feel even an ounce of calm within me."
    "Damn it."
    silver "Alex, we're beginning now."
    "I'm sure it's obvious to him that I am not calm, but he has no intention of stopping today.  This is just going through the motions for him-his mind is already made up."
    "The monotonous tone of his voice makes it clear that he is just humoring me."
    silver "On the count of three. . ."
    "Somehow, hearing that strikes a competitive chord in me.  Giving up on me before we already begin?  Well, I'll show him."
    silver "Two. . ."
    "I'm able to swallow down my nerves at the last second and bring my mind to focus.  I can prove him wrong.  I can do it."
    silver ". . .One."
    "We begin."
    "Eyes closed, I center my thoughts on him.  I can feel him there, standing opposite from me, and I reach out to him with my consciousness.  I have to make a connection. . .I have to prove that I can do this, so things don't have to change."
    "But something is different this time."
    "Usually, my greatest challenge is creating that extension of myself-reaching him.  Meanwhile, Silver Phoenix has no trouble at all with this task."
    "But this time. . .I'm still reaching out with my best efforts, but it's like he's the one that's going nowhere.  In fact, it's almost like the closer I get, the further away he gets.  Like he's pulling back from me."
    "I open my eyes.  He's still standing there with his shut, as though he's actually trying."
    alex "Hey, are you doing this on purpose?  So I'll fail for sure?"
    "His eyes pop open.  He stares at me, confused."
    silver "Doing what?"
    "He looks genuinely perplexed.  Maybe he's not even doing it on purpose.  Maybe it's not just him-maybe it's me, somehow, too."
    "I don't know."
    "But the end result seems the same."
    "Maybe. . ."
    "I stare at my feet in contemplation, feeling tightness in my chest.  Somewhere distant I can here Silver Phoenix asking me what's wrong and why I stopped."
    "Maybe. . .I just need to accept that this is the way things are going to go, whether I want them to or not."
    "Trying to hold onto something that isn't working out is just going to cause more stress in the long run."
    "I raise my head back up and then startle backwards-I had been so lost in my own thoughts that I hadn't registered Silver Phoenix closing the gap between us and placing a hand concernedly on my shoulder."
    silver "Alex, if you think I'm not giving you a fair chance somehow, then we can-"
    alex "No."
    "I lightly brush his hand away and take a step back."
    alex "It's okay."
    alex "You're right-I think we need to give up.  Whatever you're looking for, I don't think I'm it."
    "He nods."
    silver "It's okay, Alex.  You don't have to look so down about it.  Perhaps I overstressed your importance to this experiment in the beginning.  It's true that I've been a little pressed for aid in this experiment, but I'm sure that someone else will come along."
    "I nod, unwilling to say that that-while still a concern-isn't my main worry right now.  Of course, he picks up on it immediately."
    silver "You know. . .just because our work together will be coming to an end, that doesn't mean everything has to.  I've always enjoyed our chats, you know.  You have a point of view that's often very contrary to my own, so talking with you often gets me thinking in unexpected ways.  I dare say it would almost be beneficial for me to be spending more time with you."
    "I stare at him, not quite sure how to respond.  Naturally, he continues with or without my input."
    silver "And I mean that for things outside of Virtuality as well, Alex.  Nothing has to end here except our working relationship.  That's what you're worried about, right?"
    "I nod a pitiful \"yes\"."
    silver "Then does hearing that make you feel better?"
    alex "To be honest. . .no.  I mean, it's easy to say something like that now, but. . .if I'm not working on the experiment, I'm not really needed anymore, am I?"
    "I avert my eyes, embarrassed to be talking so frankly with him.  I just couldn't help it though-I opened my mouth and my thoughts just sort of rolled out.  What I didn't expect, though, was to hear Silver Phoenix chuckle at my words."
    alex "What's so funny?"
    silver "It's nothing, I just. . .well, I realized what I poor job I've done at conveying just how important you've been to me beyond the experiment."
    alex "I. . .have been?"
    silver "Our time together-all of our time together-has taught me a very important lesson."
    silver "Alex, you've reminded me that traditional means of communication will always have their place.  Talking face to face. . .the words a person chooses to say and chooses to hold back. . .these things reveal perhaps just as much about a person as a direct connection to their feelings and thoughts.  Any new form of communication I could create never could, and never should, attempt to replace these things.  I only hope I can add to that."
    "It takes me a moment to remember that he is speaking both as Silver Phoenix and as Feng."
    alex "Thank you for saying that. . .although I'm not entirely convinced I've had much of an impact yet."
    "Considering my \"date\" with Feng and all. . ."
    silver "I suppose you'll just have to trust me on this one.  Sometimes it takes time for things become apparent."
    alex "So. . .what now?  I just leave and then that's it?  I don't ever come back?"
    silver "Well, not for work you don't."
    "I can't help it-my face falls a little.  It's weird to think I won't be coming back."
    silver "Buuut if you wanted to come back for a chat every now and then. . .I certainly wouldn't mind."
    "He smiles and winks.  An automatic smile twitches at the corner of my mouth.  I'm glad to know things won't change so much so quickly."
    silver "That said, I think that's enough for today.  Do me a favor and be convincing when we tie everything up with your law office, okay?"
    alex "Sure thi-"
    "But he cuts me off with a little wave and boots me out of his space."
    #TODO [alex's room]"
    "Back in the solace of my room I immediately realize that I failed in accomplishing my goal.  I was so distracted by the experiment ending that I forgot to ask him for advice about Feng.  He said he'd be happy to have me back, still, but it'll probably be awhile before I get the chance to ask again."
    "I stare at my phone, wondering if I should rethink my plan."
    "Maybe I should keep trying on my own. . .even if things aren't perfect.  These things take time, right?  I mean, isn't the whole \"figuring each other out\" stage part of the fun?  If I really get stuck, I know I can ask Silver Phoenix, but I need to give it my own shot first."

Almost every time I looked over, he seemed entirely enraptured by the show and was showing enthusiasm in ways quite unlike his usual self-leaning forward, silently tapping along to the music like he knew every note.  But there was one time, very early on in the show, when he almost looked a little teary-eyed, which was odd considering a comedic scene was taking place at the time.  Then again, I don't think his mind fully was on the show at that point. . ."

It's weird seeing him actually show some enthusiasm about something, but a good kind of weird.  I'll admit, I'm not nearly as into the show as he is, but seeing his fervor is getting me more hyped.

        cecil "Oh, Alex, I'm sorry-I didn't realize how late it's gotten.  I didn't mean to keep you so long.  We should probably start heading out."
        alex "It's okay!  Thanks for telling me so much about the show.  I feel like I really get it now.  It might even be fun to see it again sometime, now that I know all these things."
        cecil "I'm glad to hear it reached you so well."
        "I can already hear him slipping back into his more rigid mannerisms, but I think that same excitement is still bubbling just under the surface."
        "We start our trek back up the now-empty aisle to the exit.  Cecil is walking ahead of me, and he occasionally turns and looks over his shoulder to make sure I'm still behind him."
        cecil "Er, Alex. . ."
        alex "What's up?"
        cecil "I'm sure you'll consider this uncharacteristic of me, but I want to thank you for convincing me to come out tonight."
        "I want to ask again just why he had to be convinced to see a show he was so obviously infatuated with in the first place, but I know I should refrain."
        alex "You don't really need to thank me for that.  I mean, I got a free ticket out of it, too."
        cecil "Yeah, but. . .I know I would have ended up regretting not going.  I'd thought about just going by myself, but the thought of it was abhorrent."
        alex "I don't think anyone would have cared if you showed up by yourself.  I'm sure lots of people do that."
        cecil "That's not really what I meant.  If my original intention were to come alone it would have been fine, but. . ."
        "Certainly he didn't buy two tickets for nothing."
        "Knowing Cecil, he isn't going to say it outright, but I can at least hazard a guess. . ."
        "This was probably meant to be a date, maybe even an anniversary with someone whom Cecil had seen the same show with before, possibly even multiple times. "
        "Of course, something must have happened between them, probably around when Cecil started acting off."
        "I guess it isn't fair for me to have all this conjecture about Cecil's private life.  It's just a hunch, after all-even if I have the feeling that I'm at least mostly right, Cecil's the only one who could confirm this."
        "Maybe it's something he'd be willing to talk about someday?  Even I have the sense not to pry that far right now."
        "Cecil stops suddenly as we're about to enter into the lobby."
        cecil "Even if this wasn't my original intention for the night, it definitely wasn't a bad time."
        "You could just say you had fun, Cecil."
        cecil "Perhaps we could do something again-something more pre-planned, next time."
        alex "Sure, that could be fun."
        "I mean, if it means seeing more of what Cecil's like when he actually loosens up a little. . .I'm game."
        cecil "Of course, that's only a \"perhaps\".  Don't go counting on anything just yet."
        alex "Whatever you say, Cecil."
        "I realize I'm actually grinning a little as we step out into the lobby.  Who'd have thought?"

        #TODO [conference room]"
        "My sessions with Silver Phoenix grew shorter and shorter, as it became clearer we had hit a dead end.  I wasn't feeling as tense and stressed out as before, but it was a chore to have to keep participating in a flatlining experiment.  When Cecil tells me one day to bring in Feng for a meeting, his intent seems clear.  I think Feng must have known too; she refused to even look at me the whole way there.  The air in the room is heavy and awkward."
        cecil "Miss Jin, I have reviewed the reports of your progress for the past several weeks, and quite frankly, there hasn't been any."
        feng "And?"
        "She looks stubbornly away from Cecil."
        cecil "Please don't play dumb.  I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this.  It's time we put an end to this-the experiment is stopping here."
        feng "No incidents have happened."
        cecil "That may be, but Miss Jin, can you really say this is worth continuing?  I'm sure you're disappointed that things did not progress as you envisioned, but at some point you must face reality-this is going nowhere, and it would be irresponsible to continue using company resources on it."
        feng ". . ."
        "Cecil sounds like a parent lecturing a child right now, perhaps because Feng won't allow any opportunity for real discussion.  What else is he supposed to do?  This was the deal from the start."
        cecil "I don't expect you to admit it out loud, but you must understand that everything thus far has been more than conclusive enough to justify putting this to rest.  I'm sorry that things-"
        feng "You aren't sorry."
        cecil "Please don't make this difficult by lashing out at me.  You acknowledged from the start that you would accept whatever outcome was reached."
        "Feng's eyes light on me and I find myself on the receiving end of an accusatory look. My eyes dart away and I feel a pang of guilt.  Maybe if it hadn't been me. . .No, I can't let myself think like that.  I tried, and it isn't my fault things didn't work out."
        ". . .But even if it isn't really my fault, I'm sure she probably blames me for things going the way they did."
        cecil "Miss Jin, will you do as you said previously and accept this?"
        "It's clear that this isn't a question.  Cecil's looking like he just called \"checkmate\"."
        feng ". . .Fine."
        "Feng shoves her chair away from the table and stands.  I've never seen her move so quickly or with such harshness before."
        "She starts to head towards the door and I shoot Cecil a look, wondering if I should follow.  He nods.  The second I start to approach Feng, however, she holds up a hand."
        feng "Don't."
        alex "I'll take you ba-"
        feng "I'll take care of it."
        "Suddenly she's looking a lot calmer, like she's got herself reigned in again.  Her face returned to that look of total neutrality so fast, it's almost unsettling."
        feng "I'm leaving.  Consider the experiment terminated."
        "She says this lacking any emotion for the experiment I know she loves terribly. . ."
        "Is that really it?  Can she really just detach herself from it because she knows there's no hope of continuing?  I just can't picture it.  I've witnessed first-hand just how passionate she is about this experiment."
        "Feng exits the room without another word more."
        alex "I suppose that could have gone better."
        cecil "Honestly, I'm not sure it could have."
        alex "Should I go offer to take her home, anyway?"
        cecil "No, just leave it.  I'm sure she'll be fine."
        "I get the impression that Cecil doesn't really care in all the decorum now that this is over.  In the end, only Feng will be truly unhappy about this conclusion."
        cecil "I'm going to go grab my laptop so we can fill out a conclusory report.  Wait right here a moment."
        "Cecil leaves me alone to my thoughts, which naturally drift back to Feng."
        "If there's a way to continue, even if it's in secret, I bet she will."
        "Maybe knowing that is why she's able to be so calm.  Of course, this is all just speculation and I get the feeling that pushing any further would start some real issues.  In any case, if she does want to continue, things just got a lot harder for her-and it's unlikely that things will ever affect the general public."
        "I'm still not sure where I stand in all this, whether I should have that \"mission accomplished\" feeling or not.  I guess I can't expect such a complicated situation to result in such black-and-white feelings, but I can't help wishing for it, either."
        "I really am sorry that this is what became of her dream, but I believe we did the right thing.  I wouldn't have taken a side that I didn't believe in."
        "I mean, if her experiments were really a good thing, would I have felt such an enormous sense of relief upon finally being released from having to do them?"
        "Thankfully Cecil reenters the room, interrupting my thoughts."
        cecil "I don't expect this will take long-we've already done the important part.  I'll just need a few comments from you to send on and we can call this unfortunate business finished."
        alex "Sounds good to me."
        "I can't wait until this is all just a memory and I'm doing mundane work again."
        "Cecil pops open his laptop and I scoot my chair next to his, perhaps closer than I would have a few weeks ago.  He doesn't have quite the frigid air around him that he used to, and I've come to accept his usual sharpness of tone as just a part of his outer shell.  Now that I know that there's something more beyond that, it's a little easier to deal with."
        cecil "After this I have a few more tasks that I would like your help on and-"
        "Cecil freezes after logging onto his laptop.  It seems he was in the middle of doing something when he last stopped using it-browsing theatre tickets, to be precise."
        "Cecil tries to keep a poker face up as he closes the webpage at the speed of light."
        cecil "Er, excuse that.  Just a bit of browsing on my break."
        "Sure, Cecil.  \"Browsing\"."
        "I'm starting to realize just how much of the Cecil I knew before this was a façade, and one that seems to be crumbling fast, at that.  I take some joy in knowing that I'm among the probably very few people who have seen the real Cecil."
        alex "Oh, um, I just remembered something I wanted to ask you.  Have you tried that café that just opened across the street yet?  I've heard they have great deserts."
        cecil "No, I haven't.  I'm admittedly not much of a sweets person, though, so I'm afraid I can't give you any recommendations."
        alex "Yeah, that sounds about right.  I was wondering if you might want to try it out with me for lunch, but. . ."
        cecil "Well, hold on, I only said I don't like sweets.  I've heard their lunch menu is quite good."
        alex "Oh.  So, you'd like to?"
        cecil "Yes, that doesn't sound so bad."
        "I think that's his way of saying \"that sounds nice\", so I'll take it."
        cecil "Now then, enough chit-chat.  Let's get to work.  We each have plenty of things to work on after this, you know."
        alex "Right!"
        cecil "And sit up a little straighter-your posture hardly says \"professional\"."
        alex "Okay, Cecil."

        "Despite my preparation, I'm fumbling and already nervous as I start to pull up a few documents on the screen."
        alex "Cecil, if we could just take a moment to look back at my previous reports, I feel-"
        cecil "There's no need to look back at them.  I'm well-acquainted with the material.  What about them?"
        "His sharp interruption catches me completely off-guard and throws me off-script."
        alex "Then certainly you must have come to the same conclusion that I have-that the experiment has met a dead end.  If we continue, we'll just keep getting the same lack of results over and over again."
        cecil "I'm aware, Alex.  The point of continuing at this point is simply to wear Miss Jin, out, remember?  If we pack it in too soon, she'll claim we didn't give it enough chance and this whole debacle will just continue."

I have to at least try to make it clear to him just how much the experiment is affecting me.  What have I got to lose at this point?"
        "Cecil clears his throat."
        cecil "As I said, unless there's something new to say, this discussion doesn't need to continue."

        "I just need to open my mouth and say it, but my jaw feels glued shut somehow.  Cecil folds his hands on the table and leans for me."
        cecil "So, Alex.  Is there something else?"
        "A few seconds pass, during which I'm acutely aware of every sound present in this room and the one outside it.  The ticking of the clock, Cecil's little puffs of impatience, rapid typing and papers being shuffled. . ."
        "Cecil is looking doubtful."
        "The words are right there."
        ". . .But I just can't bring myself to say them.  It's like some invisible force is holding the words back."
        alex "Sorry, I. . ."
        "A part of me rages inside.  What the hell just happened to me?  Why couldn't I say it?"
        "Cecil sighs and shakes his head."
        cecil "Alex, really, you need to be more professional in the future.  I had a tight schedule already for the day, and now you've put me behind only to admit you have nothing to say.  This is exactly the sort of thing we consider when deciding on promotions."

        alex "Okay."
        "No, not okay-nothing is okay right now.  Damn it!  Why can't I just say something?"

        alex "Uh-huh."
        "I can already feel the crucial moment slipping away. . .Not that it mattered-the words are still locked inside of me, almost as though something were holding them captive."
        "My chest is feeling tight, as though a cold, icy hand was clutching onto it."
        cecil "Now then, if you've really got nothing to say, I'll be off.  We'll have a discussion later about mismanaging work time."
        "Suddenly the room feels choked for air.  I need to focus, but I can't."
        "Cecil's grabbing his things and is almost out the door.  I could still say something."
        "He's opening up the door now and I'm still sitting here, useless."
        "He's walking out. . .along with my last chance to say anything."
        "Cecil takes his first steps out the door and shuts it behind him without so much as a look back. . .There goes my chance."
        "I lean back in my chair and bring my hands to my face.  My breath still feels short and my hands are trembling.  My entire body feels like it's weighed down by cement, and my thoughts are in a frenzy-how am I supposed to go on like this?"
        "I take a few deep breaths to try and get myself together, but I know it's just a temporary fix."
        "Why couldn't I say anything to Cecil. . .?  The more I reflect on it, the more it feels as though someone else took the reins for a moment and was directing my actions.  I mean, I knew exactly what I wanted to say and I had the resolve to say it.  So what held me back so suddenly?"
        "A creeping paranoia in the back of my mind says it's not just coincidence, and it isn't just my own fears getting to me.  Is there some small possibility that it's related to the experiment?  That somehow Feng and Silver Phoenix's desire to keep the experiment has been incepted into me, now?"
        "No, no, no. . .this is a very dangerous line of thinking.  If I start now, I'll be an even greater wreck than I am right now.  I need to put that away for now and focus on the main point:  I can't keep going like this. . .I'll just stop being able to function at all, pretty soon."
        "After several more deep breaths I'm finally feeling calm for the moment, allowing one more thought to worm its way to the front of my mind:  This isn't just about me."
        "This may be only affecting me right now, but the whole purpose of the experiments is to bring the technology to a public audience."
        "How could I let that happen, after all that I've experienced?  Even if the experiment were to be refined, the fact that it even has this potential in the first place. . .It shouldn't be allowed to continue, right?"
        ". . .or is this just me searching for any justification to try and shut it down before I'm driven to a full-on nervous breakdown?"
        "Either way, I don't think I can go back on the resolve that this needs to end.  But how?  Even if talking to Cecil were possible, I don't think it would get me anywhere-he's too dead-set on having things follow the plan he has plotted out already;  I mean, anyone else would probably notice and be concerned over how this has been affecting me, but all I ever seem to receive is admonishment from him."
        "I'm scheduled for another experiment session tomorrow.  Just the thought of it sends my body into a cold fear again.  I can't allow myself to go back and possibly sink my mind and body further into this panic."
        "But what can I do?"
        "If I simply refuse to go, they'll only stick some other poor sap with the job, and I've already determined that talking to Cecil isn't an option."
        "Maybe. . .Maybe Feng would listen?"
        "It seems like a longshot since she's the one with the most interest in keeping the experiment going, but I feel like underneath that cold and unresponsive exterior is the mind of a thoughtful and possibly even empathetic person."
        "If she really understood the extent that her experiment had to hurt people, would she even want it to continue?"
        "Some small voice in the back of my mind-the same voice that held me back from saying anything to Cecil-reminds me that she probably already knows of the effect the experiment has had on me and either finds it insignificant or outright doesn't care."
        "But. . .I've got to at least try, right?"
        "I pull out my phone and write out a quick meeting request with her and receive an almost immediate reply back."
        "I'm already trying to formulate what sort of things I plan to say to her and am praying that I can actually spit out the words this time.  If this opportunity fails. . .I'm not really sure what comes next, but I know it must be something."
        "This experiment must end."

        "I'm even more at a loss as to what to say to her.  All I have is my own personal feelings and experiences, but I know that's probably not worth much to here-at least, not measured up against what's at stake for her.  I know it's asking a lot, but I can't just tuck my tail between my legs and give up now.  Every time I even consider the experiment, my body's natural flight-or-fight responses kick in, telling me to keep as far away from it as I possibly can."
        "I'm not sure what my chances are with her-I think she'll be easier to talk to than Cecil, but she has a lot less reason to do what I'm asking."
        "I really am sorry to have to turn against her like this, but at this point, it really is a \"have to\".  I know I can't, and I just can't let others do it either given all that I've experienced."

        alex "Listen, there's a legitimate reason I'm saying this.  I've been feeling so much anxiety and fear lately because of the experiment, it's practically taken over my life. . .It's overwhelming, and it's not just in my head.  It's like it's done something to me to make me this way.  I feel like human minds just aren't meant to be messed with in that way."

        alex "Please, just forget the data for a moment and actually listen to me.  I'm not just trying to upset you, okay?"
        feng "Anecdotal evidence is still not reason to end the experiment.  If you're struggling, then perhaps you are not a suitable subject for testing after all."
        "I can tell she's hurt.  She probably thought she had finally found someone to be on her side.  But damn it, this isn't just about her!"
        alex "Feng, please.  Look me in the eyes.  I know this experiment is precious to you, but you don't understand what it's really like!  I mean, you aren't even participating in it yourself, so how can you-"
        feng "Inaccurate."
        alex "What?"
        feng "You assume I'm not participating.  That's inaccurate.  I've experienced it fully on my own and confidently assert that it is safe."

I say this because I have been personally affected by this-it's been steadily pushing me towards a mental breakdown the entire time I've been working on it!"
        "From somewhere in the crowd I think I hear my name being shouted.  But why would that be. . .?"
        alex "I've raised concerns with both parties involved in this-both my direct manager and Miss Jin, herself.  Nether of them are being responsible with this."
        "I hear my name again.  I'm sure of it this time.  But from where?  No one else seems to notice it."
        alex "This needs to be ended permanently, and I feel I can't trust anyone-both Miss Jin and individuals overseeing these matters at Virtuality-to ensure that this happens."
        cecil "Alex!"
        "Of course.  I should have recognized that voice.  I don't pause even for a second as I continue to account all the things that have occurred, trying to convey just how deeply afraid I feel to all these microphones and cameras."
        cecil "Alex, rescind these statements at once!"
        "No one even glances his way, and he can't shoulder his way through the wall of media personnel.  He might as well not even be there.  I keep going and I'm careful that our eyes don't meet.  Instead, I focus on all the shocked and empathetic faces try to imagine that anyone watching this at home will mirror those same looks.  I want to think that I am doing good here."
        cecil "You are violating the agreement you signed, Alex!"
        "I know Cecil, but I don't care right now.  Maybe I'll care once this whirlwind spins itself out and I'm left to deal with the aftermath. . .of which I'm consciously aware could be some very serious legal persecution, but right now. . .it doesn't seem to matter.  For the first time in what feels like an eternity, I feel calm, despite how dire the current situation is."
        "This is what I need to do."
        "They're nodding and murmuring amongst themselves as I speak.  Those murmurs are turning to disgust and fear as I elaborate on my experiences.  They're getting stirred up now.  I can't even hear or see Cecil anymore-perhaps he stormed out."
        "I've said just about all I came here to say.  It's out of my hands from here on out."
        "I lean into the microphone and speak my final words on the matter."
        alex "Please shut Virtuality down."
