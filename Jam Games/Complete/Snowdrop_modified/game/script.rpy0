"Tonight is a silent night, as I sit in front of my childhood home for the last time. After I return from my trip, the place will have nothing but a Christmas tree and a set table."
"Tomorrow morning, I will be saying goodbye to a childhood friend who has watched my family and I grow within its walls."
"I will be leaving for my Aunt’s Bed and Breakfast in the countryside, while my mother packs all of our good memories into boxes. At least, the ones that fit."
"The house I grew up in isn’t really a house, but no one ever asks about the two bedroom walk up I grew up in."
"House is a strange word. I don’t really like the way it tastes on my tongue. It feels so much more extravagant than what I live in. Why don’t people ever ask about my home?"
"A house has enough bedrooms for every person living in the place. It has a comfy living space, a backyard and a front porch."
"What it doesn’t have is a bedroom so small that the mattress acts as a couch, desk and bed all at once. A house doesn’t have four flights of stairs between its occupants and a musty smelling lobby."
"But, most importantly, a house doesn’t have the memory of a deceased loved one lingering in all of the things scattered around the cramped space." 
"Not in the always tidy hamper, or the uncluttered top shelf of the wall unit. Not even in the almost empty refrigerator."
"My two bedroom walk up certainly isn’t a house, but it is a home. A home filled with painful memories that I can no longer stomach. That’s why I’m leaving."
"Not for good, that would kill my beautiful mother’s taped together smile. But, I’ll leave until all of the holiday cheer in the streets of New York City is gone. Until I no longer have to watch my mother wrap a gift and label it “To Craig, from Santa.”"
"We all know that he is going to miss the third Christmas in a row but it will still feel like the very first time we celebrated his favorite holiday without him."
"I’ll have to look into my mother’s hollow eyes as she tears open the finely wrapped paper and exclaim that Craig would appreciate the gift."
"It’s always the same thing too, the sterling silver guardian angel pin that she had given him almost five Christmases ago. The one she and I had spent hours arguing with the postal service on the phone for after they lost the package on route."
"This Christmas, my mother will not have to spend the happiest time of year with three spots at the table unclaimed. She has my word. Until that time comes, I need to leave the overtly “in your face” holiday cheer that New York City is famous for."
"Not because I don’t appreciate a large Christmas tree in every well known area or ice skating rinks filled with people chattering excitedly. It’s because I just don’t know how the city is able to keep moving when, to me and my mother, it feels as if it the world has stopped spinning."
"My hand glides over the aluminum mailbox. The same aluminum mailbox that my mother and I would wait anxiously by. Our best memories were when we would finally receive a letter from Craig after months; we’d both smile and count our blessings."
"Tonight, there is a different sentiment as I look at the mailbox. Tonight I feel melancholic. But alas, all good things must come to an end eventually. Goodbye, old friend."

"I’m already seated on the train. If living in New York City has taught me anything, it’s that behind a crowded train is usually an empty one. Score one for me!"
"I place my bulky duffel bag on the seat next to me. It’s a little tactic I like to call “uncomfortable silence.” Most people will see my bag and glare at it silently, but they won’t tell me to move it."
"You can’t get away with it for the whole ride, but for a few stops it’s totally possible. So until some old woman demands I move my stuff, I’m sitting here pretty comfortably."

"On top of that, I have no money. I’m a 22 year old college graduate with a degree in film and a surmounting pile of debt. I had to take out several loans to even afford. All I have to show for my education is one movie and it isn’t even that good. I still have no permanent job offers."
"Thomas De Luca’s voice can’t magically toss money in my lap or bring the smile back to my mother’s face. But, he does help me tune out the world for a few minutes so I can pretend like my problems don’t exist."

"I notice that the scenery around me has changed as the train pulls away farther and farther from the big city. There are so many trees and the sunlight isn’t hidden by tall buildings."
"Riversone might not be so bad after all. Especially if it looks as peaceful as the scene through the train window."
"Riversone is the perfect middle point for travelers heading up north to the textile driven cities or south to the more rural areas. Or so the internet has told me."

"The best way to come up with a character is to just look at the people around you. Trains are the best place to do that, especially in New York."
"I try to figure out who the person might be by what they’re wearing or how their posture is. It’s a little quirk of mine that helped me through tons of screenwriting classes in college."
"This particular man is strange. As he nestles himself into his corner seat, I take a long look at him. The man looks out of place, and it’s no doubt because of the scarf that is pulled all the way up passed his nose."
"He definitely gives off the vibe that he’s trying to hide himself. Whether it be him trying to mask his identity or a deeper self esteem issue, I don’t know. I’m not a psychologist, just a people watcher."
"The man’s blond locks peek out from his oversized wool hat. His eyes are closed and the woman next to him is staring at him in awe. How the heck does she gravitate towards the shadiest looking guy in the train car?"
"Ughh...how many more stops until I reach my destination?"
