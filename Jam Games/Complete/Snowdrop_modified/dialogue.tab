chapterOne_d95ac686		"This particular man is strange. As he nestles himself into his corner seat, I take a long look at him. The man looks out of place, and it's no doubt because of the scarf that is pulled all the way up passed his nose. "	game/script.rpy	268		chapterOne_d95ac686
chapterOne_1509dce1		"He definitely gives off the vibe that he's trying to hide himself. Whether it be him trying to mask his identity or a deeper self esteem issue, I don't know. I'm not a psychologist, just a people watcher."	game/script.rpy	271		chapterOne_1509dce1
