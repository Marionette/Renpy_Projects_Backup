    bk "I was with my friend. We were in a garden of flowers. I think I was really young, maybe five years old?"
    bk "\nAnyway, this friend of mine, I can't remember her name, she had a thing for perfume."
    nvl clear
    bk "She always had a perfume bottle with her, which probably belonged to her mom's."
    bk "\nShe would use the perfume on various things in the garden, like she was marking them."
    nvl clear
    bk "It was kinda funny."
    bk "I didn't know why she did it, and me being a kid, didn't think much of it at that time."
    nvl clear
    bk "One day she gave me a button."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"What's this?\" I asked."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"This is a fairy button.\" she said. \"There is a fairy inside!\""
    nvl clear
    bk "\"R-Really? A fairy?\""
    nvl clear
    bk "\"Yeah, so you keep it in a secret box and spray something sweet on them everyday, and then, they'll appear to you in your dreams and be your friend. Do you want to keep it?\""
    nvl clear
    bk "\"Yes!\" I replied. \"Does the fairy... have a name?\""
    nvl clear
    bk "\"When you open the box on the first day, the first name that you think of will be the fairy's name.\""
    bk "\n\"My fairy's name is Grace.\""
    nvl clear
    bk "So I took that button and kept it safe. I stole my mother's perfume from her dresser and kept it 
    in my pocket all throughout the evening."
    bk "\nThat night, when everyone was asleep, I sprayed the perfume on the button, feeling equal parts 
    silly and hopeful. I talked to it like there was a real fairy in my box."
    nvl clear
    bk "The next day, I opened the box, excited at learning the button's name."
    nvl clear
    bk "She told me her name was Peridot."
    nvl clear
    bk "I asked my friend if there were more fairy buttons."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"Yes!\" she said,"
    bk "\"Fairies like hiding is small things like rocks and flowers. They like buttons because buttons are pretty, but fairies can be everywhere!\""
    nvl clear 
    bk "\"Then how do you know if there is a fairy in a button?\""
    bk "\"Well first, they only stay in loose buttons because those attached to shirts get washed.\""
    nvl clear
    bk "\"Next, if you spray a button and the scent stays for days, then there is a fairy hiding in there.\""
    nvl clear
    bk "I stared at her with awe. Kid's logic has answers to everything."
    nvl clear
    bk "So I bought a small spray bottle of perfume that next week, because my mom 
    caught me using hers."
    nvl clear
    bk "She caught me because everytime she opened my door, the undeniable scent of perfume would linger 
    long after I've closed my box."
    nvl clear
    bk "That scent of rosewood and cinnamon filled my room..."
    nvl clear
    bk "And everytime I breathed it in, I knew Peridot was there."
