    bk "Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy."
    bk "She had chestnut brown hair and bright blue eyes and the town called her \"Little Fearless\"."
    bk "\nLucy was not afraid of anything."
    nvl clear
    bk "Not her father the chief, nor her big brothers with their spears and swords and brawn."
    bk "\n\nShe was not even afraid of the forest."
    nvl clear
    bk "There were rumors of monsters lurking the forest surrounding Lucy's village, a rumor that sprouted 
    belief and grew into a stone wall that enclosed the perimeter of their land."
    bk "\n\nLucy didn't believe the warnings."
    bk "\n\nShe asked to explore the woods once and for all, to convince everyone there is nothing to be afraid of."
    nvl clear
    bk "Her father denied this request."
    bk "Oh, how she stomped and shouted and screeched."
    bk "Her face reddenned and she screamed herself hoarse, but her father didn't relent and she was instead sent 
    to her room without supper."
    bk "\nIt was then Lucy decided that she would see the woods for herself no matter what."
    nvl clear
    bk"One day, as Lucy was exploring, she heard a whisper."

    nvl clear
    bk "The voice came from the other side of the wall, and for a little bit, Lucy was afraid."
    bk "\nShe thought about calling her father, but Lucy knew he would probably forbid her from playing outside if she did."
    bk "\n\nBesides, it would take more than that to scare Lucy."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"Show yourself!\" Lucy shouted."
    nvl clear
    bk "..."
    nvl clear
    bk "There was no response."
    nvl clear
    bk "Lucy pressed her ear against the stone wall that separated the village 
    and the woods beyond."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}{size=-5}\"...Bet you can't see me over here...\"{/size}{/font}{/i}"
    bk "It said again."
    nvl clear    
    bk "The voice was barely a whisper."
    bk "It was so soft it could've simply been the sound of blood rushing in Lucy's ears."
    bk "\nBut it spoke again and this time it was a bit louder."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"...Bet you can't see me over here...\"{/font}{/i}" 
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"...Lucy...\"{/font}{/i}"
    nvl clear  
    bk "The voice was muffled, like someone was also pushing their face up against the other side of the wall."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"Bet you can't see me Lucy. Bet you can't.\"{/font}{/i}"
    nvl clear
    bk "\"No, I can't! Show yourself!\" Lucy said."
    bk "She wasn't going to let a scary voice talk her down."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"Wanna play hide and seek?\"{/font}{/i} the voice asked."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"I do.\" replied brave Lucy."
    nvl clear
    bk "She followed the voice along the the stone wall, walking its length and checking for the voice now and again."
    bk "\nSometimes the voice was loud, sometimes it was barely audible."
    bk "\nSometimes, Lucy had to press her ear on the wall to hear it again."
    nvl clear 
    bk "Sometimes she would touch the wall and find it warm, like the creature transmitted its heat through its breath."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"Where are you?\" Lucy would ask, and the voice sounded like it came from far away."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}{size=-10}\"Bet you can't see me Lucy. Bet you can't.\"{/size}{/font}{/i}"
    nvl clear
    bk "There were times she wondered if she should go back."
    bk "Her village seemed so far away now. The markings on the walls looked foreign."
    bk "\nBut she pressed on."
    bk "\n...Even during the worrying times she couldn't hear anything."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"...Bet you can't see me...\"{/font}{/i}"
    nvl clear    
    bk "She would hear it say, and it kept her going."
    nvl clear
    bk "Before long, she reached a portion of the wall that was low enough to climb."
    bk "\nThe stones were shattered in a rubble heap and Lucy grabbed on to the taller rocks and hoisted herself up."
    nvl clear
    bk "Up until that moment, she expected the voice, probably a huge monster with sharp talons and bristles of black hair, to jump out of the stone wall and grab her."
    nvl clear
    bk "There was no monster."
    nvl clear
    bk "Just a carpet of trees and the darkening purple of the sky as the sun went to rest."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"Bet you can't see me Lucy. Bet you can't.\"{/font}{/i}"
    nvl clear
    bk "It was the voice."
    nvl clear
    bk "Curiously, she was not afraid of it anymore. It was almost familiar, after all."
    nvl clear
    bk "Almost... {w}comforting..."
    nvl clear
    bk "{i}{font=fonts/shadow.ttf}\"Bet you can't see me Lucy. Bet you can't.\"{/font}{/i}"
    nvl clear
    bk "And Lucy saw through the shadows of the looming trees, two red pinpricks blinking like sinister stars."
    nvl clear
    bk "\"I do. I see you.\" Lucy said."
    nvl clear
    bk "It was the last thing she ever saw."
    nvl clear
    bk "The End."
