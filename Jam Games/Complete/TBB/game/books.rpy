    "Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy."
    "She had chestnut brown hair and bright blue eues and the town called her 'Little fearless."
    "Lucy was not afraid of anything."
    "Not her father the chief, not her big brothers with their spears and long swords."
    "She was not even afraid of the forest."
    "The forest that surrounded their village was overrun with monster, and Lucy being Lucy, 
    wanted to explore the woods for its sake."
    "His father denied this request."
    "Oh, how she stomped and shouted and screeched."
    "Her face reddenned and her throat felt sore, but her father didn't relent and was sent 
    to her room without supper."
    "It was then Lucy decided that she will explore the woods no matter what."
    "One day, Lucy followed a voice. A hiss.. a threat. a challenge."
    "Bet you can't see me over here" 
    "said the voice and Lucy put her ear through the stone wall that separated the village 
    and the woods beyond."
    "The voice was barely a whisper."
    "and Lucy could have thought that it was the sound made by the blood rushing in her ears 
    as she pressed it against the wall."
    "But it spoke again and this time it was nearer."
    "Like the voice was also pushing it's face up at the wall."
    "Bet you can't see me Lucy. Bet you can't."
    "No, I can't. Show yourself." 
    "Lucy said. She was a brave child and no voice was going to talk her down."
    "Want to play hide and seek?" 
    "The voice asked."
    "I do." 
    "replied brave Lucy."
    "She followed the voice that talked behind the stone wall."
    "The voice was barely audible."
    "Sometimes, Lucy had to press her ear on the wall to hear it again."
    "It scared her sometimes because the stone wall was warm, like the creature breathed so close to the stone."
    "Where are you?" 
    "Lucy would ask, and the voice would reply a mile away and Lucy would follow it until she could feel a warm patch on the stone wall."
    "Bet you can't see me." 
    "It said again."
    "By sunset, she reached a portion of the wall that was low enough to climb."
    "Until that moment, she expected the voice, probably a huge monster with sharp talons and bristles of black hair jump out of the stone wall and grab her."
    "There was no monster as she climbed. Just a carpet of trees and the darkening purple of the sky as the sun had gone to rest.
    ""Bet you can't see me, Lucy. Bet you can't."
    "the voice said again."
    "And Lucy saw through the shadows of the looming trees, two red pinpricks blinked like sinister stars."
    "I do. I see you." 
    "Lucy said and Lucy did."
    "And it was the last thing she ever saw."
