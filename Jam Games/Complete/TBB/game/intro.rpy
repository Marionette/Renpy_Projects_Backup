    "I had a dream."
    "In my dream I was always running."
    "Sometimes I am running through forests, sometimes through a maze of 
    buildings so tall the light from the skies have dimmed."
    "Most of the time though, I am in a corridor with no end, decked with 
    doors that lead both nowhere and somewhere."
    "I open one of the many doors, and another, and another, until I am dizzy, and I do not know 
    where a room had ended or where it began."
    "I am lost."
    "Sometimes there is a monster after me."
    "A black beast."
    "I don't have to look back at my shoulder to see him."
    "He is there."
    "He is insisted."
    "But I am getting tired of running, so when I saw a door up ahead, 
    I jump into the inky darkness and slammed the door shut."
    
    "A beast is after me."
    "It is nowhere to be seen."
    "Tears fell from my eyes."
